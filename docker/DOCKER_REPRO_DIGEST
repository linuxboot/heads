# Optional: pin the Docker image used by ./docker_repro.sh to an immutable digest
# This file is read by docker_repro.sh if DOCKER_REPRO_DIGEST is not set in the
# environment. The first non-empty, non-comment line is used as the digest value.
# Acceptable formats are:
#  - sha256:<64-hex>
#  - sha256-<64-hex>  (will be normalized to sha256:<hex>)
#  - <64-hex>         (will be normalized to sha256:<hex>)
# Example:
# sha256:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

# Place the digest on the first non-comment line below (remove the leading '#')
# Version: v0.2.7
