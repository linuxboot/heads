The present code properly detects and populates devices_suggest with /dev/sda2 /dev/sdc1 prior of entering function prompt_for_existing_encrypted_lvms_or_disks. 

As can be seen under real hardware produced DEBUG trace as follow:

'''

So here:
- "DEBUG: LUKS num_devices: 2, devices_suggest: /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb1" is right.
- "DEBUG: LUKS num_devices before array: 2, devices_array: /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb1" is still right
- "DEBUG: LUKS num_devices after array: 1, devices_array: /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb1" shows there is 2 elelements in array, while num_devices is now 1, which is wrong
