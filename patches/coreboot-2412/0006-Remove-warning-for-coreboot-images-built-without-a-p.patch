Subject: [PATCH 06/11] Remove warning for coreboot images built without a
 payload

I added this in upstream to prevent people from accidentally flashing
roms without a payload resulting in a no boot situation, but in
libreboot lbmk handles the payload and thus this warning always comes
up. This has caused confusion and concern so just patch it out.
