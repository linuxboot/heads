# Configuration for Asus P8Z77-M Pro
#This board is a better choice over the P8H61 for a cost effective Heads + QubesOS desktop with ME neuter+disable compatibility. 
#The P8H61 ecosystem was complex with multiple variants 
#(some not even having a TPM header, and others having RamInit issues with some memory sticks), 
##while less feature rich than the P8Z77 family. The P8H61s that were compatible still required 
#some ME #sections (FCRS,EFFS) to be whitelisted in order to post, which introduced unknowns. 
#The P8H61s #also needed a larger flash chip to work with heads than the manufacturer supplied 
#4M, which add#ed complexity for the average user.
#
#The P8Z77-M Pro is able to offer more SATA connectors (2x 6Gb, 4x 3Gb, 2x eSATA) as well as 
#more full size expansion ports. The board has a PS/2 keyboard port as recommended for QubesOS. 
##The board comes with 8M flash chip as standard.
#
#The i7-3770 is the best CPU available for the board, with VT-x & VT-d both present

#ME & ROM
#The board supports Intel LGA1155, which allow for ME removal (both neuter+disable work), ME 
#region resize/shrinking (aka 'maximized' board), as well as VSCC table modification..
#The blob download script uses the manufacturer supplied ME and IFD and performs the necessary 
#hashing. The download script also removes the VSCC table by overwriting a NULL at the VSCC 
#length table and FF bytes at the VSCC identifier table - using a printf with dd. The download 
#script also resizes the rom layout and minimizes ME while maximizing space.
#The P8Z77-M Pro comes as standard with an 8Mb Flash chip, which means that no modification is 
#needed to replace the chip is order to use heads as we shrink ME and 'maximize' this board by 
#default, leaving just 335396 bytes available.
#The P8Z77-M Pro has both TPM1 and TPM2 modules available, though at time of writing only the 
#TPM1 module would be usable with heads until the TPM2 work is completed. All testing was done 
#with a TPM1 module
