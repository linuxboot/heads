# WARNING: This system remains perpetually vulnerable to Spectre v2 (CVE-2017-5715). Mitigations and microcode updates previously applied are now known to be ineffective due to QSB-107 and related CVEs. If Spectre v2 is a concern in your threat model, consider migrating to a platform with ongoing microcode support. Proper OPSEC for Memory Use MUST be followed:https://www.anarsec.guide/posts/qubes/#appendix-opsec-for-memory-use
# Configuration for a T480 running Qubes 4.2.3 and other Linux Based OSes (through kexec)
#
# CAVEATS:
# This board is vulnerable to a TPM reset attack, i.e. the PCRs are reset while the system is running.
# This attack can be used to bypass measured boot when an attacker succeeds at modifying the SPI flash.
# Also it can be used to extract FDE keys from a TPM.
# The related coreboot issue contains more information: https://ticket.coreboot.org/issues/576
# Make sure you understand the implications of the attack for your threat model before using this board.
#
# Includes
# - Deactivated+neutered+deguarded ME and expanded consequent IFD BIOS regions 
# - Forged GBE MAC address to 00:DE:AD:C0:FF:EE MAC address (if not extracting gbe.bin from backup with blobs/xx80/extract.sh)
#   - Note that this MAC address can be modified under build/coreboot-VER/util/bincfg/gbe-82579LM.set
# - Flashable Thunderbolt tb.bin blob extracted from https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n24th13w.exe
#   - It is zero-padded to 1MB and should be flashed to the Thunderbolt SPI chip,
#     which is not the same as the 16MB chip to which the heads rom is flashed.
#     External flashing is recommended as the only way to reliably fix a bug in the original Thunderbolt software on the SPI chip.
#     You can find a guide here: https://osresearch.net/T430-maximized-flashing/
#
# - DOES NOT INCLUDE Nitrokey/Librem Key HOTP Security dongle remote attestation (in addition to TOTP remote attestation through Qr Code)
