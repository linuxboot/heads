# Unpack a Linux initramfs archive.
#
# In general, the initramfs archive is one or more cpio archives, optionally
# compressed, concatenated together.  Uncompressed and compressed segments can
# exist in the same file.  Zero bytes between segments are skipped.  To properly
# unpack such an archive, all segments must be unpacked.
#
# This script unpacks such an archive, but with a limitation that once a
# compressed segment is reached, no more segments can be read.  This works for
# common initrds on x86, where the microcode must be stored in an initial
# uncompressed segment, followed by the "real" initramfs content which is
# usually in one compressed segment.
#
# The limitation comes from gunzip/unzstd, there's no way to prevent them from
# consuming trailing data or tell us the member/frame length.  The script
# succeeds with whatever was extracted, since this is used to extract particular
# files and boot can proceed as long as those files were found.
