    cbfs-init, insmod: Bring back params/filenames into PCR measurements
    
    cbfs-init used to measure filenames as well as the data in the files,
    but after refactoring it only measures file data.  This means files
    could be renamed, or contents pivoted, without affecting the PCR
    measurements.  Bring back the filename measurement.
    
    Similarly, insmod used to measure module parameters, but no longer
    does.  Though we don't currently insert any modules with parameters,
    there's no reason to leave this open to break later, bring back the
    measurement.

    The 'warn' message was not very effective, because change-time.sh
    clears the screen right after.  Prompt with whiptail instead, which
    also lets the user know what's happening before we drop them into a
    series of prompts.
    
    Let the user skip changing time if they really want to.  While they
    usually should set the time, it's rather frustrating if Heads forces
    them to go through these prompts when they don't want to.

    config/coreboot-librem_11.config: Fix build, restore Wi-Fi coreboot cfg
    
    a9e6dfe8 ("config/coreboot-*: Turn off WIFI support in coreboot. If
    regression, will turn on case by case") broke builds for Librem 11.
    CONFIG_DRIVER_WIFI_GENERIC is required for Librem 11 as it describes
    its built-in Wi-Fi card in the device tree.
    
    The CONFIG_DRIVER_INTEL_WIFI driver does not actually seem to be
    needed directly, but this is the only way to bring in the generic
    driver, which is not selectable itself.

    This was a yes/no prompt but didn't actually have a question in it,

    Include the current time so the user can tell if it's correct.
    Mention that if it's incorrect they should change the time and check

    Adjust prompt wording when entering fields.  Technically the desired
    value isn't always between min/max, because min and max are also

    No need to repeat an incorrect value, it is right there on the screen

    change-time: Ask whether to retry, don't say "any key", loop instead of recurse
    
    Ask whether to retry instead of always retrying, so users can escape
    if there is a problem setting the date instead of being forced to enter
    values until it works.
    
    Ask to press Enter instead of "any key".  "Any key" prompts are
    generally misleading, because there are usually keys that won't
    actually work (e.g. Ctrl, Caps Lock, Shift).
    
    Loop to retry if setting the date fails instead of recursing.

    change-time: Don't offer minimum field value as default
    
    There's little value to offering the minimum field value as a default
    IMO:
    * it's rarely accurate (e.g. minute 00 is only accuate 1/60 of the time)
    * it's very obvious to just press '0'<enter> instead (and no longer
      needs to be '00')
    * it eliminates a lot of wordiness you otherwise have to read (or more
      likely, ignore)

    change-time: Complete input with Enter, allow Backspace, don't require leading zeroes
    
    Allow Backspace in input.  It's really frustrating otherwise if a typo
    cannot be corrected, and worse, the backspace key actually produces a
    character that becomes part of the input.
    
    Complete input with Enter.  It is surprising when the script just
    moves on right away once a fourth/second digit is entered, and worse,
    users expecting to press Enter could reasonably press it before
    realizing the script did not require it, which then skips the _next_
    prompt inadvertently.  Users with imperfect typing might double a
    digit unintentionally, do not force them to proceed with an incorrect
    value.
    
    Removing '-n $digits' from read does both of those.  Add '-r' so
    backslashes do not have unexpected behavior.
    
    Don't require leading zeroes, zero-pad automatically.

    keys: Remove PureOS signing key
    
    PureOS ISOs still are not detach-signed and it is misleading that there
    is a key here.  Remove it, we'll add it when the ISOs are signed.

    targets/qemu.mk: Fix skip-if-exist in swtpm_setup
    
    Commit 46cad549 ("WiP flake.nix: make docker image usable for...")
    added 'root' to the swtpm_setup call, but broke skip-if-exist because
    the flags are supposed to be comma-separated.  swtpm_setup was ignoring
    skip-if-exist and would fail if the config files exist.
    
    Put a comma there so it works again.

    nitropad-nv41/ns50: readd Intel WIFI otherwise fsp error
    
    Enabling CONFIG_DRIVERS_INTEL_WIFI=y in turn enables CONFIG_DRIVERS_WIFI_GENERIC=y which is needed.
    
    Bugfix, pushed on master without review: this is regression preventing master to report succcess for last master commit.

    coreboot configs: unify turning CONFIG_USBDEBUG off
    
    sed -i '$a CONFIG_USBDEBUG=n' config/coreboot-*.config
    grep -R CONFIG_COREBOOT_VERSION boards/ | awk -F "/" {'print $2'} | while read board; do if ! sudo make BOARD=$board coreboot.save_in_oldconfig_format_in_place  > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo $board failed;fi; done
    
    Note:
    Boards that are unmaintained accumulates settings addition per the sed call.
    
    Why deactivate:
    - Well, this is equivalent of cbmem -c which gives way too much information from attacker.
    
    TODO: add an helper later on so that builds aimed at testing coreboot version bump pass to release mode or something.
    
    As of this commit, we accept that bricks might happen and that troubleshooting will be made in a case basis?!

    Makefile: Don't check out submodules when cloning a git module
    
    Checking out submodules was much worse for coreboot, it has many
    submodules and only a subset of them are actually used.  coreboot knows
    to sync the needed submodules during its build.
    
    Instead, just remove the errant command that did not actually work.

    Makefile: When cloning a repo from Git, update submodules correctly
    
    When cloning a repo from Git, actually change to the repo directory to
    check out the submodules as well.  Without the -C <dir>, the submodule
    checkout happened in the Heads repo itself, which has no submodules.
    
    This is important for coreboot being built in CI.  Without this, the
    coreboot submodules will be checked out automatically by the coreboot
    build system during the build, meaning they will not be in the
    prepped module cache.
    
    A trade-off though is that at this point, we don't know what submodules
    are actually needed - we will clone some that are not needed.  coreboot
    knows to skip some submodules during the build if they are not needed.

    modules: drop iotools
    
    As discussed in: linuxboot#1704
    there is no need to include iotools module for nitropads.
    
    Since there is no board using it, and we see no reason to use
    it in the future (the EC udpate will not require it, as update
    will be server by coreboot in the future), drop the module as well.

    modules/coreboot: 24.02.01-Purism-1, remove CFLAGS overrides, needs nss
    
    Update Purism coreboot to 24.02.01-Purism-1.
    
    Remove CFLAGS overrides when building coreboot.  These overrides break
    24.02.01, which added (and needs) --param=min-pagesize=1024.  This has
    happened repeatedly in the past since Heads has to duplicate coreboot's
    CFLAGS if it overrides them.
    
    Specifically, the build fails with this error:
    src/commonlib/include/commonlib/endian.h:27:26: error: array subscript 1 is outside array bounds of 'void[0]' [-Werror=array-bounds=]
       27 |         *(uint8_t *)dest = val;
          |         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~
    In function 'setup_default_ebda':
    cc1: note: source object is likely at address zero
    
    That's because coreboot is attempting to write to EBDA at physical
    address 0x40e, just above 1024.  That is a valid address for x86, but
    it's too close to 0 by default for GCC, --param-min-pagesize=1024
    allows writes to physical addresses above 1024.
    
    coreboot shouldn't need any of the usual Heads CFLAGS overrides for
    reproducibility; it is already reproducible.
    
    Fix indentation in modules/coreboot.  Make accepted it before because
    the indented lines followed a variable assignment, so they couldn't
    be part of a recipe.  That assignment is now gone, so they're now
    interprted as part of a recipe for the `.configured` target just above,
    they should not be indented.
    
    Add nss to flake.nix, needed as of 24.02.01.
    
    Update Librem coreboot configs for 24.02.01-Purism-1.  Notably, the
    board Kconfig changed for Mini v2 in coreboot, so this is needed for
    correct builds.

    config/coreboot-librem_11.config: intel_iommu=igfx_off on Heads cmdline
    
    intel_iommu=igfx_off is needed on the Heads kernel command line for
    memtest86+ to work.  Without this parameter, the screen blanks when
    memtest86+ starts testing.
    
    This is unique to Librem 11, probably because it is the only device
    using FSP GOP for graphics init in coreboot.  (libgfxinit does not yet
    support Jasper Lake.)

    Use nixos-unstable channel's prebuilt qemu_full with canokey support builtin, downloaded from nix cache
    
    - flake.lock: bumps lcoekd package list to latest packages list through 'nix flake update'
    - flake.nix : comment out customizations of derivatives, removing canokey-qemu lib since qemu_full depends on qemu which depends on canokey-qemu by default now
    - flake.nux: add 'less' so that 'git log' is usable
    - circleci/config.yml: use docker v0.1.9
    - README.md : update docker image maintainer notes to ease upstreaming of docker images and for others to play around, requiring dockerhub account
    
    For testing iterations of this, I used:
    docker_version="v0.1.9" && docker_hub_repo="tlaurion/heads-dev-env" && sed "s@\(image: \)\(.*\):\(v[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\)@\1\2:$docker_version@" -i .circleci/config.yml && nix --print-build-logs --verbose develop --ignore-environment --command true && nix build .#dockerImage && docker load < result && docker tag linuxboot/heads:dev-env "$docker_hub_repo:$docker_version" && docker push "$docker_hub_repo:$docker_version"
    Then added final commit, and pushed.

    Fix key to card failing with invalid time when moving keys to smartcard on master (Opt: Authenticated Heads)
    
    - Revert gnupg toolstack version bump to prior of #1661 merge (2.4.2 -> 2.4.0). Version bump not needed for reproducibility.
      - Investigation and upstream discussions will take their time resolving invalid time issue introduced by between 2.4.0 and latest gnupg, fix regression first under master)
    
    - oem-factory-reset
      - Adding DO_WITH_DEBUG to oem-factory-reset for all its gpg calls. If failing in debug mode, /tmp/debug.txt contains calls and errors
      - Wipe keyrings only (*.gpg, *.kbx)  not conf files under gpg homedir (keep initrd/.gnupg/*.conf)
    
    - flake.nix
      - switch build derivative from qemu and qemu_kvm to qemu_full to have qemu-img tool which was missing to run qemu boards (v0.1.8 docker)
      - add gnupg so that qemu boards can call inject_gpg to inject public key in absence of flashrom+pflash support for internal flashing
    
    - flake.lock: Updated nix pinned package list under flake.lock with 'nix flake update' so qemu_full builds
    
    - README.md: have consistent docker testing + release (push) notes
    
    - .circleci/config.yml: depend on docker v0.1.8 (qemu_full built with canokey-qemu lib support, diffoscopeMinimal and gnupg for proper qemu testing)
    
    TODO:
    - some fd2 instead of fd1?!
    - oem-factory-resest has whiptail_or_die which sets whiptail box to HEIGHT 0. This doesn't show a scrolling window on gpg errors which is problematic with fbwhiptail, not whiptail

    PR numbers being numerical and hopefully not conflicting with each other, keeping track of commits per their upstream PR should make sure they can be applied cleanly on top of each other
     as opposed to commit id related patches that git apply will apply in random order.

    using the Heads workspace path, which is not what we want.  It does

    WiP flake.nix: make docker image usable for testing as well, target: qemu-coreboot-whiptail-tpm2 with swtpm and canokey for smartcard
    
    - include nix tools inside of the docker to be able to call the garbage collector prior of creating docker.
    - protect roots from garbage collection (WiP)
      - Requires external preparation call so that nix (the binary) is not wiped as well. See NIX_REPRO_NOTES at the end of the file for repro notes
       - Could probably be improved. Works as of now and created a 4Gb vs 3.02Gb docker image I'm uploading now.
    - CircleCI bumped to use v0.0.9 version including this
    - CircleCI now depending on flake.lock for all cache layers. Will rebuild clean once again
    
    So now we have qemu with canokey support in image, nix basic tools inside of container. Possible to call docker with DISPLAY, see NIX_REPRO_NOTES as of now.
    That feels nice. No need of USB security dongle to have TPM based TPMTOTP nor detach sign? Not tested but feature is there
    
    TODO:
    - make docker creating nicer in the Nix way.
    - Add canokey support under targets/qemu.mk
    - add canokey board version
    
    At least we have reproducible stack and testing stack being in same docker image. Docker image moved from 991.18MB (v0.0.8) to 1.18GB (v0.0.9)
    - And I tried to clean binaries of symbols here! Seems like I do not know enough of the Nix way here.

    Makefile: add yet another helper real.remove_canary_files-extract_patch_rebuild_what_changed: reextract packages, repatch sources (might fail, easy to fix) and rebuild only what changed (not a lot)
    if patch fails to apply, its because patch file creates a file and doesn't expect it to exist.
    just call rm on the file reported to exist, and relaunch build.
    
    Deletes ./install/*/* and permits to rebuild all dependencies in order, just based on freshly extracted and patched code.
    Bonus, this saves your SDD from unneeded wear and rebuilds faster then all other Mafile helpers.
    
    That's my favorite.

    CircleCI + Makefile: remove limitation to loadavg of 16 in Makefile, test CPUS=8 to maximize loadavg on CircleCI with 4 CPUs & 8GB ram
    
    See first lines of output of any make command. Change aimed to be respectful of CI resource (8GB ram 4CPUs)
    
    With CPUS=8 AVAILABLE_MEM_GB=4, CircleCI outputs:
    !!!!!! BUILD SYSTEM INFO !!!!!!
    System CPUS: 36
    System Available Memory: 4 GB
    System Load Average: 12.99
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Used **CPUS**: 8
    Used **LOADAVG**: 8
    Used **AVAILABLE_MEM_GB**: 4 GB
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    **MAKE_JOBS**: -j8 --max-load 8
    
    Variables available for override (use 'make VAR_NAME=value'):
    **CPUS** (default: number of processors, e.g., 'make CPUS=4')
    **LOADAVG** (default: same as CPUS, e.g., 'make LOADAVG=4')
    **AVAILABLE_MEM_GB** (default: memory available on the system in GB, e.g., 'make AVAILABLE_MEM_GB=4')
    **MEM_PER_JOB_GB** (default: 1GB per job, e.g., 'make MEM_PER_JOB_GB=2')
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Let's try without any limitation...

    ci: Simple/mechanical tweaks to config file
    
    Got rid of long lines in favor of more lines for readability. Cleaned up
    some comments/typos and unnecessary cruft*. Finally ran prettier on the
    file for its automatic formatting, including whitespace clean ups.
    
    cruft:
    
    -  && when already set -e
    - run commands with trailing \
    - deleted commented out "OLD STUFF"
    - sorted listy looking things because unsorted stuff bothers me :) (I
      held back on sorting the board build definitions though, thats
      probably too much).

    modules/tpm2-tools: add with-sysroot, TSS2_ESYS_3_0_LIBS to configure args
    
    Thanks to @JonathonHall-Purism, that pointed to me that sysroot was
    neglected in tpm2-tools configure step.
    
    I wonder why this is not respected if not forced with --with-sysroot and
    TSS2_ESYS_3_0_LIBS="-ltss2-esys -L$(INSTALL)/lib"?

    modules: minor refactor/tweaks
    
    Just some minor clean ups like fixing whitespace and sorting things. I
    added (bash)/removed (libusb) white space in order to look like the
    other modules.
    
    I sorted the --enable/--disable/--with blocks so that common stuff
    looked similar which should aid in comparing modules. I also removed a
    couple of duplicate config options (--disable-fallback-curses &
    --disable-regex).

    Remove hard coded paths in shebang lines
    
    Remove hard coded paths from shebangs and other references because they
    do not play well in nix-land. Either use /usr/bin/env to do runtime PATH
    based lookup or avoid absolute paths so PATH look up happens instead.

    Currently this is the only way to get the debug log.  If we add a way
    from the GUI, we may want to log the board and version somewhere else

    kexec-boot: Only capture kexec -d output to log, not console/kmsg
    
    LOG() is added to log to the log only (not kmsg, more verbose than
    TRACE).
    
    DO_WITH_DEBUG only captures stdout/stderr to the log with LOG().
    
    kexec-boot silences stderr from kexec, we don't want it on the console.
    
    No need to repeat the kexec command when asking in debug to continue
    boot, it's no longer hidden behind verbose output from kexec.

    functions: Add visibility to DO_WITH_DEBUG without affecting command
    
    DO_WITH_DEBUG traces command exit status (if failed), stdout/stderr (if
    not empty), and PATH (if command was not found).  The caller still
    observes the exit status, and stdout/stderr still go to the caller as
    well.
    
    This way, DO_WITH_DEBUG can be inserted anywhere with minimal spam in
    the logs and without affecting the script.

    LUKS header change validation at both sealing and unsealing of TPM Disk Unlock Key.
    
    Fixes linuxboot#1092.
    Supersedes linuxboot#1093
    
    - Cherry-picks ed1c23a (credit to @hardened-vault) thank you!)
    - Addresses and correct self-review under linuxboot#1093 (@hardened-vault: you don't answer often here!)
      - kexec-unseal-key: Warn a user who attempts to default boot while his Disk Unlock Key passphrase fails to unseal because LUKS headers changed.
        (linuxboot#1093 (comment))
      - kexec-seal-key: Identical as in ed1c23a
      - kexec-add-key: Tell the user that the Headers did not change when changing TPM released Disk Unlock Key
        (Through changing default boot at Options->Boot Options -> Show OS boot options: select a new boot option
        and set a Disk Unlock Key in TPM, accept to modify disk and sign /boot options)
        - Here, we cancel the diff output shown on screen linuxboot#1093 (comment)
        - And we change the warning given to the user to past tense "Headers of LUKS containers to be unlocked via TPM Disk Unlock Key passphrase did not change."

    - Add additional requirements to linux config
    - Add additional CONFIG_MOBILE_TETHERING=y to all maximized board configs
    - Fix issue under network-recovery-init to NTP sync against NTP server pool
    - Extend network-recovery-init to first try NTP sync against DNS server returned by DHCP answer
    - Remove network-recovery-init earlytty and tty0 redirection (console should be setuped properly by init in all cases)
    - If CONFIG_MOBILE_TETHERING=y added to board config and network-recovery-init called, wait to user input on instructions and warning 30 secs before proceeding (non-blocking)
    - Machines having STATIC_IP under board config won't benefit of autoatic NTP sync
    
    Since network-recovery-init can only be called from recovery shell now, and recovery shell can be guarded by GPG auth, this is PoC code to be used to complement TOTP being out of sync
    
    TODO(Future PR):
    - Refactor into functions and reuse into TOTP/HOTP being out of sync automatically.

    functions: Improve detect_boot_device to silence exFAT errors
    
    When testing a possible boot device, detect its partition type and
    skip grub, LUKS, and LVM partitions.  These aren't mountable as /boot,
    this silences spurious exFAT errors.
    
    In detect_boot_device, skip testing CONFIG_BOOT_DEV a second time if it
    is found as a block device.  This avoids doubling any errors shown from
    checking this device, no sense trying it twice.
    
    Refactor some logic to avoid duplication - extract
    device_has_partitions and use it in detect_boot_device, extract
    mount_possible_boot_device and use it instead of duplicating the logic.
    
    Move find_lvm_vg_name() to /etc/functions.
    
    Avoid mixing up similarly-named devices like 'nvme0n1'/'nvme0n10' or
    'sda'/'sdaa' - it's probably unlikely that many devices will appear,
    but looking for partitions in '/sys/class/block/<device>/' instead of
    '/dev/' would avoid any collisions.

    init: Silence exFAT errors when mounting iso9660; reorder exfat last
    
    Since exFAT support was enabled, mounting an iso9660 filesystem prints
    spurious exFAT errors to the console.  That is because busybox mount
    tries all filesystems in the order listed, and exfat precedes iso9660
    (those are the last two in our config).  Most filesystems are silent
    when used on the wrong type of filesystem, but exFAT logs errors, which
    appear on the console.
    
    Move exFAT after iso9660, so iso9660 filesystems won't show these
    errors.  The errors will still appear if the filesystem is actually
    exFAT but cannot be mounted.
    
    There's no significant risk of misdetecting a remnant iso9660
    superblock here either.  Although an iso9660 superblock could fall in
    the unused space between the exFAT boot region and the FAT itself,
    mkfs.exfat does zero this space so it is unlikely such a remnant
    superblock would exist.

    initrd/bin/kexec-unseal-key: never show final PCRs content but in DEBUG mode/Recovery Shell
    
    Next steps on this is introspection and PCRs reconstruction helpers, which will output in DEBUG and be usable from recovery shell.
    We have to keep in mind that providing those tools is useful in DEBUG mode and for users having access to Recovery Shell.
    But currently, having access to cbmem -L output and final PCRs content is making it too easy for Evil Maid to know what needs to be hardcoded to pass measured boot.

    Uniformize vocabulary: LUKS TPM Disk Unlock Key & LUKS Disk Recovery Key
    
    When playing with long fbwhiptail/whiptail messages, this commit played around the long string using fold.
    
    '''
    echo -e "This will replace the encrypted container content and its LUKS Disk Recovery Key.\n\nThe passphrase associated with this key will be asked from the user under the following conditions:\n 1-Every boot if no Disk Unlock Key was added to the TPM\n 2-If the TPM fails (hardware failure)\n 3-If the firmware has been tampered with/modified by the user\n\nThis process requires you to type the current LUKS Disk Recovery Key passphrase and will delete the LUKS TPM Disk Unlock Key slot, if set up, by setting a default boot LUKS key slot (1) if present.\n\nAt the next prompt, you may be asked to select which file corresponds to the LUKS device container.\n\nHit Enter to continue." | fold -w 70 -s
    '''
    
    Which gave the exact output of what will be inside of the fbwhiptail prompt, fixed to 70 chars width:
    
    '''
    This will replace the encrypted container content and its LUKS Disk
    Recovery Key.
    
    The passphrase associated with this key will be asked from the user
    under the following conditions:
     1-Every boot if no Disk Unlock Key was added to the TPM
     2-If the TPM fails (hardware failure)
     3-If the firmware has been tampered with/modified by the user
    
    This process requires you to type the current LUKS Disk Recovery Key
    passphrase and will delete the LUKS TPM Disk Unlock Key slot, if set
    up, by setting a default boot LUKS key slot (1) if present.
    
    At the next prompt, you may be asked to select which file corresponds
    to the LUKS device container.
    
    Hit Enter to continue.
    '''
    
    Therefore, for long prompts in the future, one can just deal with "\n 1-" alignments to be respected in prompts and have fold deal with cutting the length of strings properly.

    initrd/bin/root-hashes-gui.sh: Qubes support, faster hash creation
    
    Don't spew the root hashes to the console when creating the hash file.
    This speeds up hash creation significantly.  A basic Qubes install on a
    cheap (slow) SATA SSD reduced from about 1.5 minutes to just under 1
    minute, and a PureOS install on a fast NVMe disk reduced from 2.5
    minutes to 1 minute.
    
    Support opening LVM volume groups to find the root disk.  If an LVM PV
    is found, its group is opened and the 'root' volume is used.  There is
    no way to set the volume name in this iteration; this is the default
    name used by Qubes and probably common to many LVM OS installations.
    LUKS and LVM can be mixed.  Tested LUKS (PureOS) and LUKS+LVM (Qubes).
    
    Always cd to "$ROOT_MOUNT" in a subshell, improves robustness of
    scripts (previously some functions only worked if they were called
    after another function had cd'd to "$ROOT_MOUNT").

    functions: TRACE_FUNC and DEBUG_STACK
    
    Add TRACE_FUNC to trace the file, line, and name of the calling
    function.  File and function names don't have to be duplicated in a
    TRACE statement with this (they tend to become inaccurate as functions
    are renamed and the TRACE statement is forgotten).
    
    Add DEBUG_STACK to dump the bash stack to debug output.
    
    Configure bash with --enable-debugger.  Bash doesn't actually include
    the entire debugger, this is just some supporting variables for it.
    Evidently, BASH_SOURCE[n] is only set within a function if this is
    enabled.  I couldn't find this indicated in any documentation, but it
    happened in practice.
    
    Compressed initrd size only increased by 2560 bytes for librem_mini_v2,
    I think that is fine.  This also gives us BASH_ARGC/BASH_ARGV which
    might be useful for diagnostics.

    config/linux-librem_common-6.1.8: Rebuild starting with 5.10 config
    
    Rebuild the kernel 6.1.8 config for Librem devices starting from the
    current 5.10 config as a base.  The current 5.10 config had cleaned up
    some unneeded options, but that hadn't been carried over to the 6.1.8
    config.
    
    Graphics init still uses EFIFB in the 6.1.8 kernel.  5.10 keeps DRM+ast
    to support librem_l1um (the only board still using it).

    Allow laptops to include optional USB keyboard support
    
    Laptops can include optional USB keyboard support (default off unless
    the board also sets the default to 'y').  The setting is in the
    configuration GUI.
    
    CONFIG_USER_USB_KEYBOARD is now the user-controlled setting on those
    boards.  'CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD' is no longer used to avoid any conflict
    with prior releases that expect this to be a compile-time setting only
    (conflicts risk total lock out requiring hardware flash, so some
    caution is justified IMO).
    
    Boards previously exporting CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD now export
    CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD_REQUIRED.  Those boards don't have built-in
    keyboards, USB keyboard is always enabled. (librem_mini,
    librem_mini_v2, librem_11, librem_l1um, librem_l1um_v2, talos-2,
    kgpe-d16_workstation-usb_keyboard, x230-hotp-maximized_usb-kb).
    
    Librem laptops now export CONFIG_SUPPORT_USB_KEYBOARD to enable
    optional support.  The default is still 'off'.

    The Ada compiler is only used for libgfxinit - Intel native graphics

    Aspeed graphics initialization is written in C (but is not used yet as
    it only supports text mode in 4.11).

    modules/coreboot: Cache coreboot toolchain archives and use mirrors
    
    Download coreboot toolchain archives into packages/<arch> before
    coreboot tries to download them.  This allows us to use mirrors to get
    the archives.  We could also update the primary source this way if it
    goes down instead of patching coreboot itself (has happened for IASL).
    
    The archive versions and digests are retrieved from the coreboot
    module, so there isn't another copy of that info to maintain.  That is
    done in bin/fetch_coreboot_crossgcc_archive.sh, which uses the
    existing fetch script to do the actual download, leveraging mirrors.
    
    bin/fetch_source_archive.sh supports using a SHA-1 digest instead of
    SHA-256, since coreboot has SHA-1 digests.  It also checks if the file
    already exists (deleting the coreboot directory will cause it to be
    re-run, but the packages are already there and can be used from cache).
    
    The coreboot-4.11 IASL patch is updated to delete the outdated acpica
    archive digest (it already added the new one, but the old one was still
    there).  bin/fetch_coreboot_crossgcc_archive.sh finds the archive
    version and digest from the digest files, so only one acpica file must
    be present.

    Makefile: Support mirrors for dependency source packages
    
    Try to download dependency source packages from mirrors if the primary
    source fails or the archive has changed.
    
    Move the download and verify logic to bin/fetch_source_archive.sh.  The
    mirror list is here, currently only
    https://storage.puri.sm/heads-packages/, but others can be added.  The
    mirror list is randomized to load each mirror equally.
    
    The verify logic is moved to this script too so it can fail over to a
    mirror (or another mirror) if a mismatched archive is served, not just
    for a failure.  Makefile no longer needs to verify separately and there
    are no separate .*-_verify files any more, the archive is only moved to
    its final place once verified.
    
    Add `packages` target to just fetch all needed packages for a board,
    facilitates seeding a mirror.

    Makefile: Allow downstream config in site-local/config
    
    Allow downstreams to add config to site-local/config, which can set
    config options, including overriding board config and exporting config
    to /etc/config.
    
    The intent of site-local is exactly the same as in coreboot - it is a
    place for downstreams to add customizations that are included at well-
    defined points in the build.  site-local should never appear in the
    upstream repository.  coreboot's documentation explains this as well:
    https://doc.coreboot.org/tutorial/managing_local_additions.html
    
    Move definitions of ROM artifacts later, so site config can override
    BRAND_NAME (and still is included after board config to override it as
    well).

    talos-2: Move PPC-style tgz update package targets to targets/
    
    Move the targets generating talos-2's tgz update package to targets.
    
    While this wasn't duplicated, it breaks a cyclic dependency between
    board config and BRAND_NAME by moving the ROM output name dependencies
    later.  The logic probably would be shared with similar boards if any
    were supported, so it is in the spirit of the other targets/ shared
    target Makefiles.

    qemu: Deduplicate Qemu targets/documentation, extract from boards
    
    The 8 qemu-* targets all contained nearly-identical copies of the
    targets to prepare the TPM/disk/etc. and then run Qemu.  The only
    significant differences were for TPM1/TPM2 (extra swtpm_setup step,
    addition of --tpm2 to swtpm_setup and swtpm).  ROOT_DISK_IMG used := or
    = differently in some boards, := was kept.
    
    targets/qemu.mk now defines all Qemu targets and is included only for
    qemu-* boards (by defining BOARD_TARGETS in each of those boards).
    
    The documentation was moved from qemu-coreboot-fbwhiptail-tpm1-hotp/
    qemu-coreboot-fbwhiptail-tpm1-htop.md to targets/qemu.md.  The other 7
    qemu boards' symlinks to that file were removed.

    Update oem-factory-reset - wider window to show secrets
    
    This partially fixes #1537, but while the increased width wouldn't be a problem on the NV41 AFAICT, I don't know about other machines.
    
    I don't know what @tlaurion means with "busybox's folding", which may be a better solution.

    oem-factory-reset: kill scdaemon after aes regenerate on nk storage
    
    The call to `hotp_verification regenerate` seems to leave the
    communication in a bad state, thus the following `gpg` calls fail. With
    this workaround `scdaemon` will resart with the next `gpg` call.

    Adapt NV41/NS50 changes, unify bootsplash file usage for branding
    Taken from : https://github.com/Nitrokey/heads/tree/temp-release-v2.3
    
    - Move branding/Heads/bootsplash-1024x768.jpg -> branding/Heads/bootsplash.jpg (We don't care about the size. Make filename generic)
    - Adapt all coreboot configs so bootsplash is adapted by BRAND_NAME CONFIG_BOOTSPLASH_FILE="@BRAND_DIR@/bootsplash.jpg"
      - Reminders :
        - Makefile changes Heads to defined BRAND_NAME in board config
        - Makefile changes -e 's!@BRAND_DIR@!$(pwd)/branding/$(BRAND_NAME)!g'
    - nv41/nv50
      - coreboot oldefconfigs adapted by:
        - make BOARD=nitropad-ns50 coreboot.modify_and_save_oldconfig_in_place
        - make BOARD=nitropad-nv41 coreboot.modify_and_save_oldconfig_in_place
      - linux oldefconfigs adapted by
        - make BOARD=nitropad-nv41 linux.modify_and_save_oldconfig_in_place
          - since this is shared config across nv41/ns50: it only needs to be done for a single board

    FB_EFI next step: make sure CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU_DEFAULT_ON=y is on on all intel boards touched in past commit
    
    Touches c216, x230-flash, x230-legacy and x230-maximized.
    TODO: Other boards, including AMD ones (qemu/kgpe) have this ON, including nv41/ns50 (which uses i915drm which most probably causes problems)
     Note that qemu boards use q35 in config, but were made to have both i440fx and q35, where q35 is tested, which explains why its on by default there.

    Talos-2: bring changes to a working state outside of usage of GPG key material backup as of now
    
    - Closes https://github.com/linuxboot/heads/pull/1452
    - coreboot: Take Talos II 0.7 release coreboot config file that was inside of cbfs and use it as a base upstream.
    - linux: Readd sysctl and proc requirements for cbmem to work.
    
    TODO: fix gpg2 module so that the following doesn't happen (a ppc64 thing. Can't figure out why):
    
    ```

    Makefile: Don't build ZIP update package for talos-2
    
    talos-2 builds its own tgz update package that is not currently
    integrated with the zip method.  While the zip method right now would
    theoretically if the tgz was inside it, this would have to be hooked
    up for talos-2 specifically.

    Makefile: Don't generate update package for legacy flash boards
    
    The only purpose of legacy flash boards is to be flashed over vendor
    firmware using an exploit, to then flash non-maximized Heads firmware.
    
    They are never upgraded to another legacy flash build, and they move
    the coreboot ROM from the build directory, so don't build an update
    package for those boards.

    flash-gui.sh: Show .rom or .tgz in UI, not both
    
    talos-2 (only) uses .tgz instead of .rom for updates.  Currently, both
    are treated as alternatives to a ZIP-format update archive with
    SHA-256 integrity check, extend that to the prompts to reduce clutter.
    
    Reflow the "You will need ... your BIOS image" prompt to fit on
    fbwhiptail.
    
    The .tgz format could be better integrated with the ZIP updates, but
    this needs more work specific to talos-2.

    flash-gui.sh: Extend NPF archive format to ZIP, improve workflow
    
    Allow configuring the ZIP-format update file extension with
    CONFIG_BRAND_UPDATE_PKG_EXT in board config.  Default is 'zip'.
    
    Create update package in the default Makefile target.  Delete
    create_npf.sh.
    
    Do not require /tmp/verified_rom in the update file package's
    sha256sum.txt (but allow it for backward compatibility).
    
    Show the integrity error if unzip fails instead of dying (which returns
    to main menu with no explanation, error is left on recovery console).
    This is the most likely way corruption would be detected as ZIP has
    CRCs.  The sha256sum is still present for more robust detection.
    
    Don't require the ROM to be the first file in sha256sum.txt since it
    raises complexity of adding more files to the update archive in the
    future.  Instead require that the package contains exactly one file
    matching '*.rom'.
    
    Restore confirmation prompt for the update-package flow, at some point
    this was lost.

    oem-factory-reset: Move format confirmation before resetting anything
    
    Move confirmation of formatting flash drive with LUKS percentage
    selection before any reset actions have been taken, so aborting does
    not result in a half-reset system.  Combine with the more basic
    "confirm" prompt that existed after selecting the device (but did not
    include the LUKS size information).
    
    Split up prepare_flash_drive into interactive_prepare_flash_drive (both
    prompts and formats as before), confirm_thumb_drive_format (just
    confirms the selections), and prepare_thumb_drive (now noninteractive).

    oem-factory-reset: Improve prompt flow formatting flash drive
    
    Combine prompt to disconnect other devices with prompt to connect the
    desired device.
    
    Show block device sizes in MB/GB when selecting device so it is easier
    to select.  file_selector now supports --show-size to include block
    device sizes in menu.
    
    Rework file_selector so menu options can contain spaces (use bash
    array) and to simplify logic.
    
    Prompt to select flash drive and LUKS percentage in OEM reset before
    actually taking any actions, so aborting doesn't half-reset the system.
    
    Abort OEM reset if user aborts the flash drive selection instead of
    looping forever.  (Canceling the confirmation still loops to retry but
    it is possible to exit by aborting the repeated menu.)

    Wip: now supports both backup and copy to card and gpg_auth when backup exists. Might want to discuss that implementation. Some functions needed to be moved from functions to ash_functions so that gpg_auth can be called from recovery function. That might need to be discussed as well, recovery could be moved from ash_functions to functions instead.

    x230-maximized board configs: add DEBUG/TRACE board config in comment
    
    Enabling DEBUG/TRACE options from board config vs from configuration menu is different.
    
    When enabled in board config, /etc/config is from ROM, and sourced early and make TRACE/DEBUG calls appear early.
    If added through configuration menu, those are /etc/config.user overrides extracted from CBFS and then sourced after combine_configs call
    
    If for whatever reason early DEBUG is needed on a platform, enabling in board config is needed.
    For runtime debugging, enabling Debug output from configuration menu is enough

    To support PPC crypto, it seems we will need yasm.
    To support linux capabilities, libcap would be required as well later on. :/ another point for rng-tools (which also depends on libcap-ng)

    Support branding under branding subdirectories
    
    Squash of #1502 + moving logo/bootsplash files under branding/Heads
    
    - Move logos and bootsplashes from blobs to branding/Heads/
    - Makefile: add support for BRAND_DIR which depends on BRAND_NAME which defaults to Heads if no branding
    - Boards coreboot configs: change bootsplash directory to depend on BRAND_DIR (instead of BLOBS_DIR) in bootsplash enabled configs
    - Branding/Heads/bootsplash-1024x768.jpg points to branding/Heads/d-wid-ThePlexus_coreboot-linuxboot-heads_background-plain_DonateQrCode.jpg
    - xcf file deleted. Original still under #1502 to reuse for modification without recompressing (blobs/heads.xcf)
    - CREDITS file created to point to original authors, remixers (Open for details)
      - Thanks to: @d-wid for remixing Bing's AI generated Janus logo, @ThePlexus for Qubes Box concept and @ThrillerAtPlay for its matrix background

    Blob jail: Make device firmware available during initrd
    
    Some device firmware, such as the graphics microcontroller, is needed
    during the initrd - i915 is often loaded in the initrd, and this is the
    only chance to load GuC firmware.
    
    Device firmware must still be available after the real root is mounted
    too, so update the custom firmware path in the kernel when the firmware
    is moved to /run.

    Add Librem 11 board.
    
    Librem 11 uses coreboot graphics init, which is done with FSP GOP.
    
    Set a custom keymap for the volume/power keys.  Configure the volume
    keys as up/down arrows (for navigation in fbwhiptail, and for shell
    history in the Linux console).  Configure the power key as Enter.

    librem_11: Add loadkeys (from kbd), optionally enabled
    
    Allow boards to optionally include loadkeys to set a custom keymap.
    showkey and dumpkeys (normally only needed for development) can also be
    optionally included.
    
    Remove *.map from .gitignore; this was probably intended for build
    artifacts that are now excluded via the build/ directory.
    
    Add reboot and poweroff to shell history, which is useful for devices
    lacking full hardware keyboards to escape the recovery shell with just
    "up" and "enter".

    librem_* (except L1UM): Linux 6.1, coreboot gfx init with efifb
    
    Update all Librems except L1UM (but including L1UM v2) to Linux 6.1.8.
    
    Use coreboot native graphics init.  Raise maximum framebuffer size for
    laptops to 3840x2160 (desktops default to this, but laptops default
    to a lower value).  Remove DRM modules from Linux 6.1.8 and add EFIFB.
    
    Remove Heads kernel command line options relating to IOMMU and i915,
    which are no longer needed.  Remove OS kernel options relating to
    IOMMU.
    
    For Librem 13/15/14/Mini, this fixes issues booting with 4K displays
    attached, which were resulting in crashes due to the framebuffer memory
    not being reserved properly.  memtest86+ now passes with a 4K display
    attached.
    
    For Librem L1UM v2, framebuffer boot now works.
    
    Librem L1UM remains on Linux 5.10 with Heads kernel graphic init
    (framebuffer boot still does not work).  coreboot 4.11 has native
    graphics init for Aspeed, but only in text mode.  Backporting the
    linear framebuffer support appears to be possible - the patch applied
    cleanly - but it did not work initially and will need more
    investigation.

    initrd/bin/flash.sh: Improve speed and reliability
    
    Improve speed by pre-filtering only for lines containing any tokens of
    interest to flashrom_progress_tokenize().
    
    Improve reliability by avoiding dropping tokens that cross a stream
    buffer boundary.  Occasionally, a token could be missed if it crosses a
    stream buffer boundary, due to read timing out too quickly before the
    next buffer is flushed.  If this was a state-changing token,
    flashrom_progress() would hang forever.

    librem_mini,librem_mini_v2: Enable CMOS layout, update CMOS checksum
    
    Enable the coreboot CMOS option table, which initializes CMOS if the
    checksum is not valid.
    
    There is now a checksum in the CMOS layout since 4.21, update it when
    updating the Mini v1/v2 EC power-on setting.
    
    coreboot 4.21 will reset the CMOS settings during the first boot, since
    there was no checksum in prior releases.  Heads will restore the
    automatic power-on setting during init based on config.user.

    modules/zstd: now included by default. Deactivated under legacy-flash boards
    
    Rationale:
    cpio -t alone cannot extract initrd past early cpio (microcode) in most packed initrd.
    unpack_initramfs.sh already under master comes to the rescue, but its usage up to today was limited to pass firmware blobs to final OS under boards/librem_mini_v2
    
    Debian OSes (and probably others) need to have cryptroot/crypttab overriden directly, otherwise generic generation of crypttab is not enough.
    Extracting crypttab and overriding directly what is desired by final OS and exposed into /boot/initrd is the way to go otherwise hacking on top of hacks.
    
    This brings default packed modules under Heads to 5 modules, which needs to be deactivate in board configs if undesired:
    user@heads-tests-deb12:~/heads$ grep -Rn "?= y" modules/ | grep -v MUSL
    modules/zlib:1:CONFIG_ZLIB ?= y
    modules/zstd:3:CONFIG_ZSTD ?= y
    modules/exfatprogs:2:CONFIG_EXFATPROGS ?= y
    modules/busybox:2:CONFIG_BUSYBOX ?= y
    modules/e2fsprogs:2:CONFIG_E2FSPROGS ?= y

    TPM Disk Unlock Key sealing/renewal cleanup (Triggered automatically when resealing TOTP)
    
    Changes:
    - As per master: when TOTP cannot unseal TOTP, user is prompted to either reset or regenerate TOTP
    - Now, when either is done and a previous TPM Disk Unlock Key was setuped, the user is guided into:
      - Regenerating checksums and signing them
      - Regenerating TPM disk Unlock Key and resealing TPM disk Unlock Key with passphrase into TPM
      - LUKS header being modified, user is asked to resign kexec.sig one last time prior of being able to default boot
    - When no previous Disk Unlock Key was setuped, the user is guided into:
      - The above, plus
        - Detection of LUKS containers,suggesting only relevant partitions
    
    - Addition of TRACE and DEBUG statements to troubleshoot actual vs expected behavior while coding
      - Were missing under TPM Disk Unlock Key setup codepaths
    
    - Fixes for #645 : We now check if only one slots exists and we do not use it if its slot1.
      - Also shows in DEBUG traces now
    
    Unrelated staged changes
    - ash_functions: warn and die now contains proper spacing and eye attaction
    - all warn and die calls modified if containing warnings and too much punctuation
    - unify usage of term TPM Disk Unlock Key and Disk Recovery Key

    Add external/usb disk encryption (adds exfatprogs and e2fsprogs)
    prepare_thumb_drive: default to creating 10% LUKS container on usb drive, prompts for passphrase is not provided and scan drives if no --device specified
    
    NOTE: qemu usb_thumb drive of 128 mb are not big enough so that 10% of it (12mb) can be used to create thumb drive.
    
    Adds:
    - e2fsprogs to support ext4 filesystem creation through mke2fs
    - add /etc/mke2fs.conf so that mke2fs knows how to handle ext2/ext3/ext4
    - removes mke2fs support from busybox
    - bump busybox to latest version which adds cpu accelerated hash functions (not needed per se here)
    - Adds exfatprogs to have mkfs.exfat and fsck.exfat
    - Adds prepare_thumb_drive /etc/luks-functions to be able to prepare a thumb drive with percentage of drive assigned to LUKS, rest to exfat
    - Modify most board configs to test space requirements failing
    - Talos2 linux config: add staging Exfat support
    - Make e2fsprogs and exfatprogs included by default unless explicitely deactivate in board configs
    - Change cryptsetup calls : luksOpen to open and luksClose to close to addresss review
    - etc/luks_functions: cleanup
    
    GOAL here is to have secure thumb drive creation which Heads will be able to use to backup/restore/use generated GPG key material in the future (next PR)

    coreboot configs: changeset needed to use efifb
    
    - intel igpu related - remove i915drmfb hacks and use simplefb and libgfxinit enabled fb
    - coreboot 4.19: add patch to fix https://ticket.coreboot.org/issues/500. fbwhiptail still tears screen if in native 1366x769 though
    - coreboot 4.19: add patch to enable linux tampoline handle coreboot framebuffer (merged https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/76431)
    - coreboot 4.19: add patch to enable coreboot to apply jpeg voodoo to create bootsplash.jpeg injected in cbfs at build time + CircleCI apt imagemagick
      - (Thanks Nico Huber @icon again for above patches!)
    - coreboot configs: adapt VESAFB/LIBGFXINIT to use maximum fb height/width
    - coreboot configs for iGPU only: CONFIG_LINEAR_FRAMEBUFFER_MAX_HEIGHT CONFIG_LINEAR_FRAMEBUFFER_MAX_WIDTH to native size
    - coreboot configs for dGPU based on Optional VBIOS injected: VESAFB set to 1280x1024 (maximum possible).
    
    Details:
    coreboot configs: remove CONFIG_LINUX_COMMAND_LINE="drm_kms_helper.drm_leak_fbdev_smem=1 i915.enable_fbc=0"
     - Those were needed to expose i915drmfb driver prior of efifb working.

    Nothing else shares the 4.20.1 toolchain yet, and upcoming forks are

    modules/coreboot: Clarify PPC64 toolchain comments
    
    CROSS= is needed for skiboot on PPC64 due to different endianness
    relative to coreboot.
    
    The talos_2 fork doesn't share the toolchain because it is the only
    _fork_, not board, to be precise.  We could add more boards using that
    fork without having to create a shared toolchain, it only matters if we
    add another fork or start building boards from the upstream release
    too.

    modules/coreboot: Use a specific file to mark the toolchain build
    
    Use .heads-toolchain to mark that the toolchain was built rather than
    .xcompile.  coreboot doesn't generate .xcompile until the build step,
    so all modules had to build successfully before we would stop trying to
    to rebuild the toolchain.  Build steps should generally produce the
    indicated outputs too, which was not occurring here.

    modules/coreboot: Reuse release toolchain for fork builds
    
    Reuse the toolchain from a coreboot release for fork builds.  Either
    the fork or the release can be built first, in either case the
    release's toolchain is built at the default location and reused for
    later builds.

    modules/coreboot: Define each coreboot version as a separate module
    
    Define a separate module for each coreboot version, so the module used
    to build the ROM will optionally be able to reference the toolchain
    from a different module.
    
    This will allow coreboot fork builds to use the toolchain from the
    corresponding release.

    modules/coreboot: Delete unused remnants of using musl toolchain
    
    At one time coreboot was built using Heads' musl toolchain, but this
    was later reverted.  coreboot builds with its own toolchain again.
    
    CROSS= has no effect on coreboot proper (only exception is PPC64
    skiboot payload).  It was added to coreboot by a patch that was deleted
    in 8e44853.  COREBOOT_IASL was set to the default, that was only needed
    when the toolchain was being overridden to override iasl back to the
    coreboot one.
    
    ppc64 still specifies CROSS= since skiboot is unable to find coreboot's
    toolchain from XGCCPATH but checks CROSS.  This builds skiboot with the
    Heads toolchain as before.

    modules/coreboot: Clean up module, don't share git build directories
    
    Remove coreboot 4.8.1, 4.13, and 4.17, which were all unused.
    
    Remove extra copies of EXTRA_FLAGS which duplicated the common
    definition.  The only difference was
    -Wno-error=address-of-packed-member, the warning is now disabled
    entirely everywhere with -Wno-address-of-packed-member.
    
    Use separate coreboot_version values for talos_2, nitrokey, and purism,
    which gives each a separate build directory.
    
    Move conditional blob definitions out of each coreboot version.
    
    Fix condition for coreboot-blobs - whether a module is a git clone
    actually depends on non-empty <module>_repo, not <module>_version==git.
    Fix the test so git versions of coreboot can have arbitrary names.

    qemu-*: Show how to enable restricted/basic in board config
    
    For iterating, enabling these in the board config is easiest.  It's
    also possible to manually inject config.user ahead of time, or enable
    at runtime without flashing, but the normal enable/flash/reboot path
    does not work in qemu since it is unable to flash.

    initrd/bin/gui-init: retry TOTP in case of error
    
    On platforms using CONFIG_BOOT_EXTRA_TTYS multiple processes may try to
    access TPM at the same time, failing with EBUSY. The order of execution
    is unpredictable, so the error may appear on main console, secondary one,
    or neither of them if the calls are sufficiently staggered. Try up to
    three times (including previous one) with small delays in case of error,
    instead of immediately scaring users with "you've been pwned" message.

    initrd/bin/talos-init: remove alias for cbmem and bump coreboot revision
    
    Updated cbmem searches for CBMEM exposed by kernel in sysfs before
    trying to read it from memory directly. As such, there is no need for
    pointing to that file explicitly.
    
    New coreboot revision also fixes output of 'cbmem -t' caused by wrong
    endianness.

    initrd/init: Prevent Restricted Boot bypass
    
    The early recovery shell ("hold R") and serial recovery both could
    bypass Restricted Boot since they occurred before config.user was
    loaded.  Load config.user earlier before these recovery methods.
    
    Executing a shell directly (if recovery failed) also would bypass
    Restricted Boot, additionally leaking /tmp/secret.  Remove this from
    the early recovery shell logic.  Also remove the final failsafe exec
    and move the "just in case" recovery from normal boot here instead, in
    case the regular init script fails.

    coreboot 4.11 needs acpica which moved from acpica.org to intel. Download from distfiles.macports.org instead, same hash.
    
    kgpe-d16 and librem-l1um depend on 4.11 still today in tree, even though building is successful only on debian-10.
    Fixing so people building 4.11 today are still successful.
    
    4.19+ already depends on github.com releases tarballs.

    config-gui.sh: Fix truncated restricted boot prompt
    
    The "disable restricted boot" prompt got slightly too long when fixing
    the TPM wording.  Re-wrap that line to match the others.  Wrapping
    could use some general cleanup but this is sufficient so the text isn't
    truncated.

    kexec-select-boot: Fix test for basic mode
    
    The CONFIG_BASIC test was backwards, as a result it skipped the
    LUKS disk unlock logic if basic mode was _not_ enabled.  This wasn't
    observed in the PureBoot distribution because we disable the LUKS disk
    unlock feature.
    
    CONFIG_BOOT_REQ_ROLLBACK and CONFIG_BOOT_REQ_HASH logic was also
    skipped incorrectly, though neither of these are enabled on any board
    so this had no effect in the PureBoot distribution either.
    
    Test basic with each bit of logic to eliminate duplication of the
    kexec-boot call and fix the LUKS disk unlock feature.

    seal-hotpkey: Try default PIN only for 1 month and if >=3 attempts left
    
    Only try the default PIN automatically for 1 month after key creation.
    This simplifies initial ownership but still encourages changing the
    PIN.
    
    Never enter a PIN automatically if fewer than 3 attempts remain, to
    avoid causing lockout if the PIN has been changed.
    
    Remind what the default PIN was if it is not attempted for either
    reason.

    Use 160 bits of ROM hash for TPM-less HOTP secret (up from 80)
    
    HOTP/TOTP secrets don't have to be printable.  Use binary data to
    include 160 bits of entropy instead of just 80.
    
    The secret is still limited to 20 bytes.  Most keys now support up to
    40 bytes, but tpmtotp is still limited to 20 bytes.
    
    Move the truncation to 20 bytes a bit later, for future improvements to
    detect the key's actual limit.

    initrd/bin/flash.sh: Remove '-s' "SHA-256" mode
    
    flash.sh had a special mode to read (like -r) and then sha256sum the
    resulting file.  This is no different from just a read followed by a
    sha256sum, and the only caller also had logic to sha256sum a cached
    file anyway.
    
    Just use flash.sh -r and sha256sum the result.

    untested boards: move and rename untested boards, while still building them with CircleCI if they were currently built.
    Non-impactful action, first step for #1421 based on participation in testing of #1398 and prior non-tested PRs.
    
    EDIT: last minute readd of x220-maximized boards (x220-maximized and x220-hotp-maximized boards).
     x220 is still UNTESTED (legacy, manually extracting ifs, me and gbe).

    Some prompts were missed when changing to 0 80 the first time around,

    media-scan: Simplify implementation and improve RB message
    
    Since 'standard boot' was removed, empty "$option" only occurs due to
    error now.  Die with a specific error.
    
    Now, we only proceed past ISO boot if no ISOs were present, meaning the
    disk might be a plain bootable medium.  Present a specific error for

    media-scan: Fix up whiptail prompt, remove errant "s for standard boot"
    
    The whiptail prompt text was copied from the 'read' prompt but did not
    actually have the Abort option.  Add it.
    
    The "s for standard boot" option was missing from whiptail.  For plain
    'read' it does not appear to revert to a normal boot, it actually went
    on to try plain bootable USB on the same medium.  It's not realistic
    for a disk to be both directly bootable and contain ISOs, and this
    option does not appear to have been missed since it was missing from
    the whiptail/fbwhiptail version, which almost all boards use.  Remove
    it.
    
    Handle canceling fbwhiptail with esc-esc the same as Abort.

    Root hash: Allow configuring from unset defaults
    
    Allow configuring the root hash feature when the variables are not set
    initially.  This worked on Librem boards because the boards all have
    defaults for these variables, but didn't work when those defaults were
    not present.
    
    Fix set_config function to put quotes around an added variable's value.
    
    Change load_config_value function to default to empty, so it can be
    used with non-boolean variables.  None of the existing callers cared
    about the 'n' default (boolean variables should always be tested ="y"
    or !="y" anyway).
    
    Use load_config_value in config-gui.sh for boot device and the root
    hash parameters, so unset defaults do not cause a failure.  Improve the
    prompts so the "current value" text only appears if there is a current
    value.  Use set_config instead of replace_config so the variables will
    be added if needed.
    
    Prevent enabling the root hash feature if it hasn't been configured
    yet.

    modules/flashrom: Update to 1776bb46
    
    Update flashrom - in particular, this includes support for new chipsets
    like Jasper Lake.
    
    CONFIG_INTERAL_X86 was created so CONFIG_INTERNAL could apply to other
    platforms, enable it for x86.
    
    The default build target now requires sphinx, just build flashrom
    itself.
    
    Update flashrom_progress - filter out noise in newer flashrom that
    chokes the progress bar implementation, make size detection more
    robust, improve progress bar implementation slightly.

    linux-x230-legacy.config: Disable network related option while leaving CONFIG_NET active (crypto need)
    Since legacy boards do not have e1000e as opposed to maximized builds (no network), we also deactivate:
    +# CONFIG_INET is not set
    +# CONFIG_ETHTOOL_NETLINK is not set
    +# CONFIG_NETDEVICES is not set
    
    This makes gpg24 and newer flashrom bump possible

    WiP: linux config global tweaks overhaul, unifying kernel configs and keeping important board related perks
    
    CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y: Remove preemptiveness for servers. Under heads, we are single tasking. No point having this big thing in kernel https://lwn.net/Articles/746780/
    IO scheduler: only enable CONFIG_MQ_IOSCHED_DEADLINE=y since we want maximum throughput and do not have concurrent tasks
    CONFIG_CPU_ISOLATION=y : Enable CPU Isolation accross all boards: this permits to make sure that the kernel tasks running on a CPU are not distrurbed bu user tasks
    CONFIG_MULTIUSER not defined: Removing cluttering since we are single root user under Heads anyway
    CONFIG_IO_URING=y : limit number of copy operations between kernel and user space from apps
    CONFIG_ZONE_DMA not defined: relevant for older hardware (less then 32bit addressing space)
    CONFIG_X86_MPPARSE not defined: relevant for older smp systems
    CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE is enabled and SCHEDUTIL is disabled: we want performance with CPU sched with deadline IO.
    CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS_INTEL_UNCORE and CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS_INTEL_CSTATE not defined: we want max perf on Heads
    CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION not defined: no need for syscall emulation under Heads
    CONFIG_SECCOMP not defined : usefull if BPF is enabled and used.
    CONFIG_ACPI_SPCR_TABLE=y : usefull for serial redirection table and earlycon
    CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG CONFIG_MMCONF_FAM10H unset but for kgpe-d16 which is either fam10h of fam15h
    CONFIG_DM_SNAPSHOT=y CONFIG_DM_THIN_PROVISIONING=y so that recovery shell can provide LVM/DM functionality in later PR.
    CONFIG_EXFAT_FS=y so that exfat preformated thumb drives can work out of the box
    Adjust CONFIG_HW_RANDOM per platform, removing CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_TIMERIOMEM
    Only support processor family needed per board (AMD only AMD, Intel only Intel, removing CONFIG_CPU_SUP_HYGON CONFIG_CPU_SUP_HYGON CONFIG_CPU_SUP_CENTAUR CONFIG_CPU_SUP_ZHAOXIN CONFIG_CPU_SUP_ZHAOXIN everywhere
    qemu: support both AMD and INTEL as an exception for the above.

    modules/ coreboot+linux: add helpers to edit config in place + save in oldconfig/defconfig formats
    
    both linux/coreboot:
    - save_in_defconfig_format_in_place : takes whatever coreboot config file for a make BOARD=xyz statement and saves it in defconfig
    - save_in_oldefconfig_format_in_place : takes whatever coreboot config file for a make BOARD=xyz statement and saves it in oldefconfig
    
    linux:
    - linux.prompt_for_new_config_options_for_kernel_version_bump:
      - The most useful helper as of now when doing kernel version bump.
      - Requires to save current kernel config in oldconfig (make BOARD=xyz linux.save_in_oldefconfig_format_in_place) first, then bump kernel version in board config and then use that helper to review new options and save in tree.

    config/linux-x230-*: migrate from 4.14 to 5.10 + add CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_LEAK_PHYS_SMEM=y
    
    It was impossible to use directly 4.14 defconfig and apply it to 5.10.
    Saving 4.14 in oldconfig, then editing in 5.10 was necessary.
    - E1000E module (as kernel module support...) was lost in conversion and needed to be added back.
    
    Also tuned things up:
    - legacy-flash has no RETPOLINE, no security policy at all. Has expected usb controllers modules, exFAT and bare minimal support for flashrom.
      - IMPORTANT: CONFIG_X86_IOPL_IOPERM kernel option is required by flashrom
    - legacy adds sata, retpoline, additional modules (ethernet), security policy related material on top of legacy-flash config
    - maximized adds MMC card support, mousedev+synaptic (to report presence through oem-system-info-xx30), thin provisioning+snapshot support
    - tuned with linux.prompt_for_new_config_options_for_kernel_version_bump
    
    Current storage format is oldconfig from now on for proper analysis. If needed, once can save back in defconfig prior of bumping to newer version.

    Blob jail: Add zstd-decompress, decompress more complex archives
    
    Debian 12's initrd by default now consists of an uncompressed cpio
    archive containing microcode, followed by a zstd-compressed cpio
    archive.  inject_firmware.sh only supported gzip-compressed cpio, so it
    could not extract /init from this archive.
    
    Add zstd-decompress to decompress zstd streams (uncompressed size is
    about 180 KB).
    
    Add unpack_initramfs.sh which is able to decompress uncompressed, gzip,
    or zstd archives, with multiple segments, much like the Linux kernel
    itself does.
    
    Use unpack_initramfs.sh to extract /init for blob jail.
    
    Don't compress the new archive segment containing firmware and the
    updated /init.

    modules/fbwhiptail: Update to 1.1
    
    These changes primarily improve server boards using BMC video.  The
    correct DRI card is selected even if it isn't the first one, and
    performance is greatly improved on non-UMA cards.

    modules/linux: Support building with Linux 6.1.8.
    
    This is particularly beneficial for servers with Aspeed BMC video,
    because it introduces framebuffer console acceleration.  The
    framebuffer console is much more responsive.
    
    Patches were ported from 5.10.5:
    
    0001-fake-acpi.patch: This may not be needed any more, but it applies
    cleanly and I don't think it would harm anything.
    
    0002-nmi-squelch.patch: The comment mentions qemu but I see this
    message on physical machines occasionally, so I think this is needed.
    
    0003-fake-trampoline.patch: This patch does not apply cleanly.  It
    could be ported, but I don't think it's needed, I dropped it.  Dates
    back to a very old commit where Linux was being embedded into a vendor
    UEFI firmware: a4d7654b1eee65a104053c0a2b2b882fa1ec9e44.
    
    0010-winterfell-ahci.patch: Minor change of %x to %lx in context.

    librem_mini,librem_mini_v2: Don't use three values for auto poweron
    
    PureBoot doesn't have any other three-valued settings and this doesn't
    present very well in the config UI.
    
    Instead make this a two-valued setting; drop the mode that forces the
    EC setting to "stay off" at every boot because this is the default.
    
    When disabling automatic power-on, disable the EC BRAM setting too.

    config-gui.sh: Fix refactors, simplify implementation more
    
    Stop manually loading config values, just update config in environment.
    
    Never test values against "n", since many default to empty.  Always
    test ="y" or !="y", any other value is off.
    
    Add set_user_config() function to set a value in config.user,
    combine configs, and update config in environment.  Use it in setting
    implementations.
    
    Remove toggle_config, it wasn't very useful because the settings still
    test y/n in order to show specific confirmation and success messages.

    gui-init: Implement blob jail feature
    
    Blob jail provides device firmware blobs to the OS, so the OS does not
    have to ship them.  The firmware is passed through the initrd to
    /run/firmware, so it works with both installed and live OSes, and there
    are no race conditions between firmware load and firmware availability.
    
    The injection method in the initrd is specific to the style of init
    script used by PureOS, since it must add a copy command to copy the
    firmware from the initrd to /run.  If the init script is not of this
    type, boot proceeds without device firmware.
    
    This feature can be enabled or disabled from the config GUI.
    
    Blob jail is enabled automatically if the Intel AX200 Wi-Fi module is
    installed and the feature hasn't been explicitly configured.

    Add PureBoot Basic Mode
    
    PureBoot Basic mode provides the full Linux userspace in firmware from
    Heads without requiring verified boot or a Librem Key.  Basic and
    verified boot can be switched freely without changing firmware, such as
    if a Librem Key is lost.
    
    PureBoot Basic can apply firmware updates from a USB flash drive, and
    having a complete Linux userspace enables more sophisticated recovery
    options.
    
    Basic mode boots to the first boot option by default, setting a default
    is not required.  This can be configured in the config GUI.

    Add Root file hash feature
    
    Currently Heads will check files in /boot for tampering before booting
    into a system. It would be nice if you could use the trusted environment
    within Heads and extend this to check files in / itself. This new script
    adds that functionality, however due to the length of time it takes to
    perform these kinds of checks, it doesn't run automatically (yet).
    
    This feature can be configured from the config GUI - the root device/
    directories to check can be set, and it can be configured to run during
    boot.
    
    To make this a bit easier to use, I added a feature to detect whether
    the hash file exists and if not, to display a more limited menu to the
    user guiding them to create the initial hash file. Otherwise it will
    display the date the file was last modified, which can be useful to
    determine how stale it is.

    gui-init/seal-libremkey: reduce friction when generating new secret
    
    Reduce friction when generating a new TOTP/HOTP secret by eliminating
    an unnecessary 'press enter to continue' prompt following QR code
    generation, and by attempting to use the default admin PIN set by
    the OEM factory reset function. Fall back to prompting the user
    if the default PIN fails.
    
    Also, ensure error messages are visible to users before being returned
    back to the GUI menu from which they came by wrapping existing calls to die()

    Use the Librem Key as a TPM work-alike in the absence of a TPM
    
    On machines without a TPM, we'd still like some way for the BIOS to
    attest that it has not been modified. With a Librem Key, we can have the
    BIOS use its own ROM measurement converted to a SHA256sum and truncated
    so it fits within an HOTP secret. Like with a TPM, a malicious BIOS with
    access to the correct measurements can send pre-known good measurements
    to the Librem Key.
    
    This approach provides one big drawback in that we have to truncate the
    SHA256sum to 20 characters so that it fits within the limitations of
    HOTP secrets. This means the possibility of collisions is much higher
    but again, an attacker could also capture and spoof an existing ROM's
    measurements if they have prior access to it, either with this approach
    or with a TPM.

    Introduce io386 to heads and use it to finalize chipset at runtime
    
    On some newer platforms of intel (confirmed on nehalem, sandy/ivy
    bridge), coreboot after commit [2ac149d294af795710eb4bb20f093e9920604abd](https://review.coreboot.org/cgit/coreboot.git/commit/?id=2ac149d294af795710eb4bb20f093e9920604abd)
    registers an SMI to lockdown some registers on the chipset, as well
    as access to the SPI flash, optionally. The SMI will always be triggered
    by coreboot during S3 resume, but can be triggered by either coreboot
    or the payload during normal boot path.
    
    Enabling lockdown access to SPI flash will effectly write-protect it,
    but there is no runtime option for coreboot to control it, so letting
    coreboot to trigger such SMI will leave the owner of the machine lost
    any possibility to program the SPI flash with its own OS, and becomes
    a nightmare if the machine is uneasy to disassemble, so a scheme could
    be implement, in which the SMI to lockdown chipset and SPI flash is left
    for a payload to trigger, and temporarily disabling such triggering in
    order to program the SPI flash needs authentication.
    
    I have implemented a passcode-protected runtime-disableable lockdown
    with grub, described [here](https://github.com/hardenedlinux/Debian-GNU-Linux-Profiles/blob/master/docs/hardened_boot/grub-for-coreboot.md#update-for-coreboot-after-commit-2ac149d294af795710eb4bb20f093e9920604abd). In order to implement a similar scheme for
    Heads, I wrote [io386](https://github.com/hardenedlinux/io386).
    
    With this commit, io386 will be called before entering boot routine
    to trigger the SMI to finalize the chipset and write protect the SPI
    flash at the same time. Entering recovery shell will leave the flash
    writable.
    
    (The authentication routine implemented in previous revisions has been
    split as an independent commit.)

    patches/bash-5.1.16.patch: Do not increment build number
    
    Bash uses .build to keep count of the build number, which conflicts
    with heads build system usage of .build to keep track of built modules.
    
    If .build already exists when bash/configure is run it will increment by 1
    the build number. This is configurable on the call to the support script
    support/mkversion.sh, which is called from the bash/Makefile.
    
    Patching the Makefile template used during bash configuration allows
    disabling the build number increment.

    Enable CONFIG_NO_GFX_INIT in coreboot on i915 boards with Linux 5.10
    
    We don't need coreboot to initialize graphics on this boards, this
    eliminates some unneeded code and the gnat dependency for them.
    
    Coreboot was using libgfxinit, but it was initializing in text mode.
    Heads' kernel will then switch to graphics mode, and we hand that
    framebuffer from i915 to the target kernel during kexec.

    coreboot+linux modules: add modules target helpers to edit configs (oldconfig/defconfig)
    
    Most useful to me are:
    coreboot.modify_and_save_defconfig_in_place
    coreboot.modify_and_save_oldconfig_in_place
    linux.modify_and_save_oldconfig_in_place
    linux.modify_and_save_defconfig_in_place
    Which permit to take current in tree configs and translate them into other format.
    This is useful when trying to version bump and build.
    
    Also add helpers to save in versioned version to facilitate change tracking:
    linux.generate_and_save-versioned-oldconfig
    linux.regenerate_and_save_versioned_defconfig

    coreboot-librem*: Set framebuffer kernel params for Librems except L1UM
    
    Allow leaking the DRM framebuffer pointer to userspace, and disable
    framebuffer compression, like librem_15v4.
    
    Tested booting memtest86+ and Debian netinstaller on Mini v2.
    
    Do not enable this for L1UM, it uses Aspeed graphics which still don't
    work.  qemu uses virtio graphics, which also are not working.

    librem_15v4: Disable i915 compressed framebuffer
    
    Compressed framebuffer requires the driver to track updates to the
    framebuffer from the CPU and update the compressed framebuffer.  This
    doesn't work if we kexec into an OS that will use the linear
    framebuffer, so disable it.  (The OS kernel can still use compressed
    framebuffer if it has i915.)
    
    Linux 5.8 enabled compressed framebuffer on more chipsets using i915,
    which is why this stopped working.
    
    memtest86+ and Debian (manually blacklisted i915, comparable to
    netinst) now boot correctly on Librem 15v4.  This will need to be
    enabled for other boards too.

    kexec: Add new i915 driver ID
    
    The i915 driver's ID changed again, now to i915drmfb.
    
    It's unclear why kexec checks this, it seems it could populate the
    target kernel's framebuffer info as long as it knows enough about the
    host kernel's framebuffer, which it already checks.  Maybe we could
    improve this, for now just add the new ID again.

    linux: Allow kexec in userspace to get framebuffer address
    
    kexec(8) needs to get the framebuffer address in order to set up the
    new kernel's boot parameters.  This is one of the reasons that using a
    >4.20 kernel in Heads prevents framebuffer graphics from working in the
    OS kernel.
    
    Linux 4.20 started hiding this address from userspace, because
    userspace is not supposed to need physical memory addresses.  A
    workaround was added to keep leaking the address, apparently for some
    proprietary userspace OpenGL drivers.  This requires both a Kconfig and
    a kernel parameter.
    
    This commit enables the Kconfig on the librem_common config, and the
    kernel parameter on the librem_15v4 (where I'm testing this).  We will
    need to enable it on other >4.20 configs/boards as well.

    oem-factory-reset: remove duplicates and add proper error redirection to file
    
    - Trace calls need to happen after sourcing /etc/functions not before
    - Move sourcing of external files at beginning of file, remove /etc/functions sourcing duplicate
    - gpg error redirection was sent to /dev/null where expected to be added to whiptail in case of error (2>&1 instead and redirection to file)

    fix broken OEM re-ownership process
    
    Problem
    When using a custom password for TPM, the OEM re-ownership process is broken
    
    Impact
    The OEM re-ownership process breaks for any user setting a custom password and not just using 12345678
    
    First appeared
    https://github.com/osresearch/heads/commit/6923fb5e20cfb662b76c1d1fa48e245ecd8d79fb
    
    Detail
    on line 498, if blank, the TPM custom password is overwritten with TPM_PASS_DEF (eg, when no custom password is set by the user installing)
    
    ```
    if [ "$TPM_PASS" == "" ]; then TPM_PASS=$TPM_PASS_DEF; fi
    ```
    so far so good.  $TPM_PASS should be used for all TPM interaction from this point. $TMP_PASS_DEF is now a disposed of variable.
    
    we see that happens when resetting the TPM on line 712 (generate_checksums) is that $TPM_PASS is used (correctly)
    
    ```## reset TPM and set password
    if [ "$CONFIG_TPM" = "y" ]; then
      echo -e "\nResetting TPM...\n"
      tpmr reset "$TPM_PASS" >/dev/null 2>/tmp/error
    ---SNIP
    ```
    The TPM now has either the custom password of the user, or the default of 12345678 depending on user selection.
    
    On line 712, we duck into the generate_checksums sub, which for some reason reverts to TPM_PASS_DEF
    
    ```
        # create Heads TPM counter
        if [ "$CONFIG_TPM" = "y" ];then
                if [ "$CONFIG_IGNORE_ROLLBACK" != "y" ]; then
                        tpmr counter_create \
                             -pwdo "$TPM_PASS_DEF" \
    --SNIP
    ```
    
    This then, rightly, fails due to
    ```
    Authentication failed (Incorrect Password) (ox1) from TPM_CreateCounter
    ```

    - Clarity on message displayed to user when a generic crypttab will be generated in case of no OS override

    Talos II - Have single board config
    - Based on initial server board
    - Uses whiptail as opposed to fbwhiptail (was slow and output fuzzy)
     - Simple fix to have dual KVM(BMC) and vga output for consoles
    
    Reasoning for dropping fbwhiptail support is that:
    - it is impossible to output framebuffer content through remote BMC console.
    - A workstation board config could output to fbwhiptail for VGA and give remote recovery shell access through BMC
      - If someone shows interest for that, qemu-coreboot-tpm boards can be used as reference.
      - slowness/fuzzyness of fbwhiptail output through AST would still need to be fixed in kernel drivers. Not a priority here.
    
    Limitation:
    - Since whiptail is sent to both consoles:
     - If one console goes to recovery shell, recovery shell access invalidate TPM PCR4 measurements.
       - The other console won't be aware that TPM measurements were invalidated, and will consequently:
         - not be able to unseal TOTP if refreshed
         - not be able to unseal TPM disk unlock key on default boot
       - A reboot will fix this.

    check_tpm_counter(), seal-totp, and generate_totp_htop().  The user is
    still prompted if the password is needed but was not provided, so
    existing uses in other contexts continue to work unchanged.
    
    Prompt for the password in reset_tpm() and pass it down to each of the
    above.

    tpmr: Do not hash sealing passwords, always pass passwords as hex
    
    Don't hash password used to seal an object.  This limits the password
    to 32-characters but avoids obfuscating the usage of the password.  The
    32-character limit is considered acceptable because password limits are
    lower already (GPG token limits to 25 chars).  We may allow >32 char
    passwords in the future by hashing only if the password is >32 chars.
    
    Always pass passwords as hex to tpm2-tools to avoid possible ambiguity
    if the password begins with a control prefix like 'hex:' or 'file:'.

    tpmr: Remove PCR debug dump, silence nonsense unseal errors for new TPM
    
    Remove dump of all PCRs from tpm2_extend, it was causing other errors
    to roll off the screen before they could be inspected, and it's no
    longer needed now that TPM2 is working.
    
    Silence nonsense errors from unseal if TPM2 hasn't been reset.  tpm2 -S
    with a file that doesn't exist would complain that the parameter format
    was not understood (looks like a script error), when the actual problem
    was that the file doesn't exist yet.  We can't try to unseal anyway
    without a primary handle, so just exit unsuccessfully in that case.

    tpmr: Wrap TPM1 and TPM2 unseal actions so scripts can invoke either
    
    Provide tpmr unseal to unseal a file with TPM1 or TPM2.  For TPM1, it
    wraps tpm nv_readvalue and tpm unsealfile.  For TPM2, it wraps tpm2
    unseal.
    
    kexec-unseal-key, seal-hotpkey, unseal-hotp, and unseal-totp no longer
    need to differentiate TPM1/TPM2.
    
    Fixes spurious shred errors on TPM2 that only apply to TPM1 (temporary
    sealed secret file and shred are now internal to tpmr).
    
    Fixes TPM1 disk unlock key unsealing due to logic errors relating to
    exit status of tpmr unseal or tpm unsealfile (now always uses status of
    tpmr unseal).

    flush all sessions as well.)
    
    TPM1 currently does not do anything, but the command is accepted so
    kexec-boot does not need to differentiate TPM1/2.

    tpmr: Seal/unseal using sha256 of password
    
    TPM2 is only required to support password lengths up to its longest
    hash size (32 chars for sha256).  Pass the sha256 of the password
    instead of the actual password so the password can be arbitrarily long.

    tpmr: Set flags properly on sealed file
    
    Set flags 'fixedtpm|fixedparent|adminwithpolicy'.  Plain password auth
    is no longer allowed.  For objects sealed with a password, the password
    is part of the auth policy, so both PCRs and password must be satisfied
    to unseal.
    
    Tested by manually attempting to unseal disk unlock key with password:
        tpm2 unseal -c 0x81000003 -p "<password>"
    
    This now correctly returns an error indicating this auth method is not
    allowed.
    
    Relative to the documented default flags for tpm2_create:
    
    * sign, decrypt: Not applicable to a sealed object, tpm2_create
      automatically removed these from the defaults.
    * fixedtpm, fixedparent: Kept
    * sensitivedataorigin: Not applicable an object where the sensitive
      data is not generated by the TPM.
    * userwithauth: Removed this, "user" actions must satisfy auth policy.
    * adminwithpolicy: Added this, "admin" actions must satisfy auth
      policy.

    tpmr: Fix sealing/unsealing file with both PCRs and passwords
    
    When sealing/unsealing with a password, use a policy including both the
    specified PCRs and the object password.  Fixes sealing and unsealing
    disk unlock key.
    
    tpm2 seems to have a bug in parameter decryption when using a policy
    session and password in this way, disable encryption in the policy
    session as a workaround.
    
    Flags still need to be set on the sealed object correctly, as the
    password is normally allowed on its own as an alternative to policy
    auth.
    
    Add -Q to some tpm2 invocations to silence diagnostics on stdout.
    
    Pass filename for unsealed secret rather than capturing from stdout
    for robustness against tpm2 diagnostics on stdout.
    
    Fix unseal result check in kexec-unseal-key.

    tpm2-tools: Change sense of CONFIG_TPM to mean any TPM, not just TPM1.
    
    Most logic throughout Heads doesn't need to know TPM1 versus TPM2 (and
    shouldn't, the differences should be localized).  Some checks were
    incorrect and are fixed by this change.  Most checks are now unchanged
    relative to master.
    
    There are not that many places outside of tpmr that need to
    differentiate TPM1 and TPM2.  Some of those are duplicate code that
    should be consolidated (seal-hotpkey, unseal-totp, unseal-hotp), and
    some more are probably good candidates for abstracting in tpmr so the
    business logic doesn't have to know TPM1 vs. TPM2.
    
    Previously, CONFIG_TPM could be variously 'y', 'n', or empty.  Now it
    is always 'y' or 'n', and 'y' means "any TPM".  Board configs are
    unchanged, setting CONFIG_TPM2_TOOLS=y implies CONFIG_TPM=y so this
    doesn't have to be duplicated and can't be mistakenly mismatched.
    
    There were a few checks for CONFIG_TPM = n that only coincidentally
    worked for TPM2 because CONFIG_TPM was empty (not 'n').  This test is
    now OK, but the checks were also cleaned up to '!= "y"' for robustness.

    -Documentation file under each board.md softlinks to qemu-coreboot-fbwhiptail-tpm1.md (which has been generalized)
    This is skeleton for TPM v2 integration under Heads
    
    -------------
    WiP
    
    TODO:
    - libcurl cannot be built as a tpm2-tools dependency as of now not sure why. curl currently needs to be added in board config to be built
    - Note: tpm-reset (master and here) needs some review, no handle of no tpm use case. Caller is responsible to not call it otherwise does nothing
    - init tries to bind fd and fails currently
    - Note: Check if whiptail is different of fbwhiptail in clearing screen. As of now every clear seems to be removed, still whiptail clears previous console output
    - When no OS' /boot can be mounted, do not try to TPM reset (will fail)
    
    - seal-hotpkey is not working properly
    - setting disk unlock key asks for TPM ownership passphrase (sealing in NV requires ownership, but text is misleading user as if reowning TPM)
      - We should cache input, feed tpm behind the scene and wipe passphrase and state clearly that this is TPM disk unlock kye passphrase.
    - primary key from TPM2 is invalid most of the time from kexec-select-boot and verifying global hashes but is setuped correctly at disk unlock key setup
    - would be nice to take advantage of bash function tracing to understand where we are for debugging purposes, code takes ash in consideration only
    - tpmr says it implements nv calls but actually doesn't. Removing those falsely wrapped functions would help.
      - Implementing them would be better
    - REVIEW TODOS IN CODE
    - READD CIRCLECI CONFIG
    
    Current state:
    - TPM unseal works without disk unlock key and generates TOTP properly (was missing die condition at unseal to not produce always good TOTP even if invalid)
    - TPM disk encryption key fails. Hypothesis is that sealing with USB drivers loaded and measures in inconsistent with sealed with/without.
     - TPM disk unsealing happens without USB modules being loaded in non-HOTP setup. This fails.
    
    - Current tests are with fbwhiptail (no clear called so having traces on command line of what happens)
     - Testing with HOTP implementation for sealing/unsealing since that forces USB module loads on each boot to remove this from failing possibilities

    So coreboot buildstack is built once per version and then reused on next board builds.
    Saves precious CI and local builds when developing with qemu/kvm.

    CircleCI: Make the T440p depend on Librem boards
    
    This change will improve build times by allowing the T440p to share the
    Coreboot 4.17 cache with the Librem boards. Once we update the other
    ThinkPad boards to use Coreboot 4.19, we'll make the T440p depend on the
    X230 again.

    Make T440p scripts work with relative paths
    
    Because we're using pushd/popd to make the Coreboot util invocation
    cleaner, we need to use realpath so that the scripts will work with any
    user input.

    Make T440p scripts use Coreboot from environment
    
    Before, the T440p blob scripts would look for Coreboot using the find
    command. Now, we require the user to specify the path to Coreboot in the
    COREBOOT_DIR environment variable. Also, add an output directory
    argument to each script.
    
    These changes will make it easier to integrate with the Heads build
    system and CI.

    Add T440p gbe.bin blob
    
    - I extracted the gbe.bin blob from my T440p's original ROM using the
      blobs/t440p/extract script.
    - Using a hex editor, I corrected the sign bit in part 0 that I found
      was malformed in my analysis:
      https://github.com/osresearch/heads/pull/1282#issuecomment-1400634600.
    - After correcting the sign bit, nvmutil showed that both parts of my
      gbe.bin blob had valid checksums.
    - Finally, I used nvmutil to set the MAC address to 00:de:ad:c0:ff:ee.

    Makefile: Fix cross compilation variables for pkg-config
    
    pkg-config will still pick up system default directories from
    PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR even if PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set.  Per the docs,
    cross compilation requires clearing PKG_CONFIG_PATH and setting
    PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR (which is always searched after PKG_CONFIG_PATH).
    
    Fixes issues observed in tpm2_retry branch picking up packages from
    host environment.

    xx20/xx30 maximized coreboot configs: Fix CONFIG_CBFS_SIZE to reflect ifd.bin's BIOS regions.
    
    The calculations outlined at https://github.com/osresearch/heads/pull/1282#discussion_r1072473677
    Sums to having 'ifdtool -f layout.txt ifd_shrinked.bin && cat layout.txt'
    The example for T440p:
    00000000:00000fff fd
    00021000:00bfffff bios
    00003000:00020fff me
    00001000:00002fff gbe
    
    Here: 00bfffff-00021000=BDEFFF
    Which is exact result of @rbeslow's calculations.
    
    There is an issue on haswell, maybe because of car, maybe because of non native memory init blob.
    But this is not the case for xx20/xx30 boards.

    TPM disk unlock key setup: Automatically override selected default boot option's initrd's crypttab file(s) to point to LUKS decryption key in injected cpio
    - kexec-save-default extracts initrd crypttab files and creates /boot/kexec_initrd_crypttab_overrides.txt entries pointing to /secret.key
    - kexec-insert-key applies /boot/kexec_initrd_crypttab_overrides.txt to replace initrd's crypttabs files pointing to inserted /secret.key through cpio
    - Both scripts inform the user of applied magic on screen

    Make the path to crypttab within initramfs overridable
    
    Not all distro put crypttab under /etc/ within initramfs, but finding it at
    runtime needs unpacking, which may be hard to do, so it is made overridable
    with a file at /boot/kexec_initrd_crypttab_path.txt, whose content could be
    obtained with $ cpio -t < ${uncompressed_initrd} | grep crypttab .
    
    The "target" field of the record within the crypttab stored in the root
    file system for the luks container which is going to be unlocked via
    kexec-insert-key should be modified into the same "luks-$uuid" format,
    otherwise the boot sequence will get stuck when OS is trying to unlock them
    again, in order to map them according to "target" fields written in the
    crypttab stored in the root fs.

    t440p: disable NVMe support in Linux kernel
    
    I went through all of the different options we copied from the Librem
    config. The only thing that stood out as irrelevant was NVMe support.
    However, I'm not a Linux kernel expert, and I didn't do a deep dive, so
    I'm sure there is still room for improvement.

    Add intel_iommu=igfx_off to T440p Coreboot kernel parameters
    
    Without this, neither Qubes OS nor the Qubes OS installer would start.
    Presumably, because we're "kexecing" from an already running kernel, we
    need this set at the Coreboot level? Testing revealed that including
    `intel_iommu=igfx_off` in the `CONFIG_BOOT_KERNEL_ADD` board config
    option did nothing. And, the Qubes OS default boot option already
    contains `intel_iommu=igfx_off`.

    Adjust T440p default Coreboot defconfig options
    
    Remove options that haven't deviated from defaults in the Coreboot
    Kconfig, despite being saved by `make savedefconfig`. Also, add
    `CONFIG_BOARD_LENOVO_THINKPAD_T440P`, which was missing from the `make
    savedefconfig` output, causing Heads builds to fail. And finally, bump
    `CONFIG_CBFS_SIZE` to `0x800000` (8 MiB to bytes to hexadecimal).
    
    This value for the CBFS size is arbitrary. Originally, I had totaled the
    size of all binary blobs, subtracted that from the T440p's ROM size (12
    MiB), and used the remaining space as the CBFS size (~11.68 MiB).
    However, this caused very long RAM initialization times (courtesy of
    `cbmem -t`). And, an anecdote in
    https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-os-reviews/c/lUqRrGUoEBY/m/ka7L1f2BS8gJ
    suggested that this value needs to be a power of 2.
    
    So, I picked a size I expected our Linux payload to fit into that was a
    power of 2 that I also expected would leave enough space in the ROM for
    the IFD, ME, GbE, and Coreboot.
    
    Now, it takes less than a second for RAM initialization after
    flashing/first boot (anecdotally, it seems the MRC needs to be
    "trained?").

    Add script for obtaining Haswell mrc.bin blob
    
    I based this script on the Coreboot docs:
    https://doc.coreboot.org/northbridge/intel/haswell/mrc.bin.html. While
    adding an integrity check to ensure we're obtaining the correct blob.
    
    Also, it's worth surfacing that the SHA-1 for the resulting binary is
    the same SHA that Libreboot uses in their integrity check:
    https://notabug.org/libreboot/lbmk/src/master/resources/scripts/download/mrc#L95.
    However, I elected to use SHA-256 for extra paranoia.

    modules/musl-cross: use echo from the PATH to support NixOS
    
    NixOS doesn't have a traditional FHS where echo is available at
    `/bin/echo`. Instead, we must rely on the PATH for any
    distribution-managed utilities. Reverses

    modules/hotp-verification: source libusb headers from Makefile DESTDIR
    
    Before, the configure script sourced these from the system FHS
    (/usr/include/libusb-1.0). The build failed on my NixOS build machine,
    which doesn't store dependencies in a traditional FHS. And this is the
    correct approach for reproducible builds.

    /etc/functions: fix detection of virtual flash drive in qemu.
    
    Adds check to detect device formatted as fat32 without partition table.
    
    With fat32 fdisk does not print message about invalid partition table
    and instead it'll print an empty table with header.
    In both cases total output has the same length of 5 lines: 3 about
    device info, 1 empty line and the 5th will be the table header or
    invalid partition message.

    initrd: work around a bug in busybox sha256sum
    
    busybox sha256sum will create a checksum file for uncommon file names
    (e.g. /boot/foo"$\n"bar), but fail to verify that exact file.
    https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=14226
    
    Thus disallow all files in /boot/ with strange file names at the time of
    signing for now. Verifying in the presence of new files with such file
    names in /boot/ is no issue for the kexec_tree verification due to the
    previously implemented escaping mechanism.

    initrd kexec_tree: fix various escaping issues
    
    Attempt to fix the following issues:
    1. unescaped file names may let an attacker display arbitrary
       whiptail prompts --> escape, original code by @JonathonHall-Purism
    2. whiptail itself allows escape characters such as \n
       --> use an escape character not used by whiptail, i.e. #
    3. performance issues caused by diff'ing too early -->
       only generate a diff to display to the user, if an actual issue is
       found

    - Addition of missing boards to cover all use cases
    - All TPM1 boards rely on common config/coreboot-qemu-tpm1.config
    - boards/qemu-coreboot-fbwhiptail-tpm1-hotp/qemu-coreboot-fbwhiptail-tpm1-hotp.md has been generalized
     - all other boards are softlinked to the above for usage

    Makefile: Use path agnostic bash location
    
    This patch changes the bash location in the makefile from /bin/bash to
    /usr/bin/env bash. The latter is a more reproducible location as it is
    common to more *nix systems which don't contain the former, such as
    NixOS.

    gui-init: Always go to main menu when selecting "continue to main menu"
    
    If the user selects "continue to main menu" from an error, do not show
    any more error prompts until reaching the main menu.
    
    We still try to initialize everything (GPG, TOTP, HOTP) so that the
    main menu can still show TOTP/HOTP if GPG is not configured, etc., but
    no more prompts are shown after selecting "continue to main menu".

    kexec-parse-boot: Ensure kernel/initrd paths exist in boot option
    
    If a boot option doesn't refer to a valid file for the kernel/initrd,
    ignore it.  Such an option is never bootable, because we would fail to
    find the kernel/initrd.  This could happen if the path contained GRUB
    variables, or specified a device that wasn't /boot, etc.
    
    This is checked before expanding GRUB variables.  It's unlikely that
    any kernel/initrd path containing variables would end up working when
    all variables expand to nothing (since we do not handle GRUB
    variables).

    flash.sh: single firmware read backup and logic fixes
    - Have Talos II supported by detecting correctly size of mtd chip (not internal: different flashrom output needs to be parsed for chip size)
    - Read SPI content only once: 66% speedup (TOCTOU? Don't think so, nothing should happen in parallel when flashing insingle user mode)
    - Have the main flash_progress loop not break, but break in flash_rom state subcases (otherwise, verifying step was breaking)
    - Change "Initializing internal Flash Programmer" -> "Initializing Flash Programmer"
    - Apply changes suggested by @SergiiDmytruk under https://github.com/osresearch/heads/pull/1230#issuecomment-1295332539 to reduce userland wasted time processing flashrom -V output

    build: Allow injecting GPG key at build time
    
    flashrom doesn't work in qemu, so the firmware isn't able to update its
    keyring.  Adding an already-provisioned key ahead of time works though.

    qemu: Build ATA support into kernel, enable OHCI/UHCI
    
    Set ATA and SATA configs to y, not m - modules weren't being loaded.  Other
    configs also build these into kernel, so do the same for qemu.  Remove relevant
    configs from boards since modules no longer need to be in initrd.
    
    Enable OHCI and UHCI.  qemu forwards host USB devices over a UHCI controller.
    This enables USB-forwarding a physical Librem Key or Nitrokey Pro to the VM.
    Export CONFIG_LINUX_USB_COMPANION_CONTROLLER to have enable_usb() load the
    modules - it wants both UHCI and OHCI modules, so build both.

    Remove local build of gawk make
    
    -Makefile: remove local gawk and make version compare and local build
    -modules: remove gawk and make
    -patches: remove make
    
    local make was added to build 4.2.1 on OSes that were having older version. It was then patched to be built on OSes having newer buildstack.
    local gawk was added when GPG toolstack was older then libgpg-error 1.37. GPG toolstack was then upgraded, but local gawk stayed.
    
    Removing those permits better parallelization and of builds and reduces CircleCI (and higher cores systems) to have race conditions and stalled builds

    Coreboot 4.11 boards are not properly building as of now.
    coreboot.pre fails to depend on .car.data because of a race condition that can only be mitigated by single threading CPUS=
    
    This is unrelated to other changes.
    KGPE-D16 will soon enough depend on dasharo coreboot and be ported upstream later on.

    bin/oem-factory-reset: prevent users to choose a GPG Admin PIN > 25 chars which would fail HOTP sealing
    
    Fixes https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/1167
    Circumvents https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-pro-firmware/issues/32
    Adds validation so user cannot enter GPG User PIN > 64 while we are at it.
    
    Note that GPG PINs can be up to 64 characters.
    But GPG Admin PIN will fail HOTP sealing with GPG Admin PIN of more then 25 chars.
    
    Edit: change upstream error to firmware issue, not nitrokey-app.

    oem-factory-reset: fix bug where it was impossible to just change LUKS passphrase without reencrypting encrypted container.
    
    Since /etc/luks-functions are currently exporting passphrases tested good per cryptsetup to be reused in the code,
    the logic calling both luks_reencrypt and luks_change_passphrase testing for non-empty luks_current_Disk_Recovery_Key_passphrase
    was bogus.
    
    This commit includes a new variable luks_new_Disk_Recovery_Key_desired which is set when reencryption is desired.
    The 3 use cases (reencrypt+passphrase change, reencrypt no passphrase change and passphrase change alone now only test
    for luks_new_Disk_Recovery_Key_desired and luks_new_Disk_Recovery_Key_passphrase_desired, nothing else.

    bin/network-init-recovery: generate random MAC and set it to eth0
    
    network-init-reovery can be used to automatically set RTC clock to obtained NTP clock.
    The script would fail if other devices devices previously registered on the network with the same MAC.
    Consequently, maximized boards are detected here, and a full random MAC is generated and used instead of using hardcoded DE:AD:C0:FF:EE.

    oem-factory-reset: Only set default boot option if no TPM Disk Unlock Key
    This continues to generate checksums and sign them per new GPG User PIN, but does not set a default boot option.
    The user hitting Default Boot on reboot will go through having to setup a new boot default, which will ask him to setup a Disk Unlock Key if desired.
    
    Otherwise, hitting Default Boot goes into asking the user for its Disk Recovery Key passphrase, and requires to manually setup a default boot option.

    kexec-select-boot: Simplify boot selection confirmation, reverse order
    
    Simplify the menu options by removing the duplication of the entry name
    in the menu selections; instead, use clear verbiage to distinish
    between booting one time and making the default. And as the majority of
    the boot menu is shown is when the grub entires have changed and the
    user is prompted to select a new default, so make that the first/default
    menu option.

    kexec-select-boot: Simplify boot menu entries
    
    Drop the duplicated kernel info which hurts readability, runs off the
    end of the menu window. This also makes it easier to identify which
    menu option is the default, and more closely resembles the grub menu
    shown in a traditional BIOS boot.

    CircleCI cache: have all cache layers caching packages directory
    
    Heads buildstystem:
    
        Makefile logic will download modules packages under ./packages, check itheir integrity, then extract it and patch extraction directory ONLY if no corresponding .*_verify files are found under ./packages directory. They are extracted under build/modulename-ver/ where patches are applied prior of building them.
        build/module* .configured is written when packages are configured under build/modulename-ver/.configured
        build/modules* .build is written when packages are built under build/modulename-ver/.build
    
    CircleCI caching subsystem notes:
    
        A cache name tag is calculated in the prep_env stage early at each beginning of a workflow, and consists of a cache name, appended by a calculated digest signature (which is the final hash of hashed files (the hash of a digest).
            Look for the following under .circleci/config.yml:
                "Creating .... digest statements" : they are basically files passed under sha256sum to create a digest.
                restore_cache keys: they are basically a string concatenating: name + checksum of digest + CACHE_VERSION. Only the first cache is extracted following declared order.
                save_cache keys: same as above, only saving non-existing caches. That is, skipping existing ones and creating missing ones.
        A cache is extracted at the beginning of a workflow if an archive matches an archive name, which consists of a name tag + digest hash + CACHE_VERSION
        A cache is created only at the end of a workflow ("Saving cache...").
            Caches are specialized. Caches are linked to checkumming of some content. And the largest available cache is extracted on next workflow, only extracting the directories/files that were contained in that cache.
        A workspace cache ("Attaching workspace..."), as opposed to a end workflow cache, is passed along steps that depends on prior workflow, as specified under CirclecI config. The current CircleCI config creates a workspace cache for:
            make + gawk + musl-cross-make (passed along next)
            the most massive board config for each coreboot version (passed along next)
            which is finally leading to the workflow cache, specialized for different content that should not change across builds.
                That is 3 caches
                    musl-cross-make and bootstrapping tools (builds make and gawk locally) as long as musl-cross module has same checksum
                    a coreboot cache, containing all coreboot building directories, as long as coreboot module and patches are having the same hashes
                    a global cache containing alla builds artifacts (build dir, install dir, musl-cross dir etc)
        Consequently, a workspace cache contains all the files under a path that is specified. For heads running under CircleCI, this is ~/project, which is basically "heads" checked out GitHub project, and everything being built under it.
        When a workflow is successful, save_cache is ran, constructing caches for digest hashes that are not yet saved (which corresponds to a hash matching muslc-cross module hash, coreboot+patches digest hash and another one for all modules and patches digest hash.
        On next workspace iteration, pre_env step will include a "Restore cache" step, which will use the largest cache available and extract it prior of passing it as workspace caches. This is why there is no such different in build time when building on a clean build (the workspace caches layers are smaller, and passed along. This means saving it, passing it. next workspace downloads extracts and builds on top of those smaller layers), as opposed to a workspace reusing and repassing the bigger workspaces containing the whole cache (bigger initial cache extract, then compressing and saving it to be passed as a workspace layer that is then downloaded, extracted, building on top, compressing and saving which then passed as a workspace cache to the next layer depending on it).
        And finally, the caching system (save_cache, restore_cache) is based on a CircleCI environment variable named CACHE_VERSION which is appended at the end of the checkum fingerprint of a named cache. It can at any moment be changed to wipe actually used cache, if for some reason it is broken.
    
    Consequently:
    
        CircleCI cache should include packages cache (so that packages are downloaded and verified only once.)
        Heads Makefile only downloads, checks and extracts packages and then patch extracted directory content if packages/.module-version_verify doesn't exist. This was missing, causing coreboot tarballs to be redownloaded (not present under packages) and reextracted and repatched (since _verify file was not present under packages/*_verify)

    Move enable_usb earlier
    
    It is going to be enabled later anyway (if CONFIG_HOTPKEY=y), so it can
    also be simplified by enabling it at the very beginning.
    
    This enables USB keyboard consistently during all boot menus, including
    the "No Bootable OS Found" prompt. It isn't a big deal for "normal"
    laptop usage, but it is important for automatic tests and also
    non-laptop systems.

    coreboot-4.11 patches: remove unwanted .orig artifacts that seems to be making CircleCI fail in the past days.
    
    Heads build system is reextracting archives and reapplying patches on each iteration.
    CircleCI optimizes building time by providing cache mechanisms and forces users to build a target under an hour.
    This is to force Open Source projects (free tier) to not be leechers of the free tier.
    
    In the past days, CircleCI bails on building coreboot 4.11 boards because some files being cached are already being present (created files from patches).
    In those, two files were unwanted artifacts, recreated on top of coreboot 4.11 extracted original files (undesired .orig files), while bailing on the creating of src/security/tpm/sha1.c from patches/coreboot-4.11/0001-Add-Heads-TPM-measured-boot-support.patch.
    
    Hopefully, this is CircleCI having a maximum of 3 automatically entered input (it fails on the 3rd)... And this fix will permit src/security/tpm/sha1.c and src/security/tpm/sha1.h to be skipped if existing.
    Below, we see that CircleCI fills patch prompts with EOF 2 times, and then waits for input and then timeouts.
    
    Here is the failing log trace from https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tlaurion/heads/990/workflows/f2a430fd-dc8c-4e95-abe3-364a0e825533/jobs/4914/parallel-runs/0/steps/0-103:

    config/linux-x230-flash: used commonly for all xx30-flash boards, this is now finally saved with savedeconfig, and removes another bunch of unneeded stuff.

    - CircleCI modified to build for coreboot 4.11 kgpe-d16_workstation on top of 4.15 passed workspace
    - CircleCI modified so that we still archive all the logs in artifacts for the current build even if failing. We now exit 1 after having archived all the log files under build/
    - Add xx30 vbios extract scripts to test. Expecting musl-cross target to fail since make and gawk aren't built
    - CircleCI: gawk was not installed in apt statements under Debian. Installing
    - Makefile: seperate and fix local make and gawk building pror of using. Otherwise, impossible to build musl-cross target seperatly.
      - Also give some debugging info at start of Heads builds to tell which local gawk and make are used, also telling which make call will be propagated in the rest of the builds
      - Fix gawk version checking, reporting bad version even if 4.2.1 as expected on debian-10 (debian-10 OS deploys gawk and make in version 4.2.1)
    - CircleCI: Changing musl-cross taget to bootstrap (gawk+make) and musl-cross-make (bootstrap_musl-cross-make) for clarity

    modules/coreboot: don't build IASL separate from toolchain
    
    Older coreboot versions (pre-4.11) required IASL to be built separate
    from the main toolchain (crossgcc), but that is no longer the case,
    and doing so causes random failures from trying to build IASL as
    part of the toolchain and separately, in parallel, each using
    -j$(CPUS) threads.
    
    Test: build any board using coreboot 4.15 under Debian 11, observe
    no random failures from building the toolchain due to false positives
    for a missing depencency .

    Adding explanatory notes re t530 and w530 dgpus
    
    This commit adds explanatory notes  and updates existing t530 and w530 boards to generally align them with the dGPU points and provide signposting for those with and those without dGPU boards. It also adds an additional README in the blobs directory to explain the vbios extraction and building process.

    Add support for t530 and w530 dGPU
    
    This commit adds support for the t530 and w530 boards to enable dGPUs. dGPU's are required for DisplayPort external displays in the t530 dgpu model, and for both the VGA dn DisplayPort external displays in the W530 (which has two dGPUs, the K1000M and K2000M, hence two boards).  The commit does the following:
    
    1. Adds automated extraction scripts for vbios modelled on the me script in the blobs directory (one per board is necessary as it is based on board-specific bios updates).
    2. Adds specific boards for the various dGPU models and corresponding coreboot configs.
    3. Updates circleci config.yaml to run scripts and test boards.
    
    Tested and working on T530 dgpu and W530 K1000M. dGPU scripts tested on Debian 10 and Ubuntu 21.04

    CircleCI: fix #1058 and partly #984
    
    CircleCI: We currently drop coreboot 4.11 builds.
    - There is a file missing in the builds. Not sure why/how this is happening
    src/soc/intel/fsp_broadwell_de/romstage/romstage.c:41:10: fatal error: build.h: No such file or directory
    Example:https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tlaurion/heads/877/workflows/7d0248d2-459c-42ad-b741-8fd56a75d527/jobs/2487
    - kgpe-d16_workstation building for all GPUs is unfortunately taking too much time to build (40 minutes).
    - Not sure why, but it seems that the kernel build paralellization is not working for 4.11 while it works for 4.13
    Makefile: Uncomment MAKE_JOBS which passes the number of jobs to numbers cores by default and --max-load of 16
    CircleCI: Remove CPUS statement to use Makefile default
    modules/newt: force build with one make job, otherwise there is a race condition in module which fails randomly expecting build modules. (TODO: FIX)
    
    Interestingly, building all coreboot 4.13 boards is happening on a clean commit just above 1h limit.
    
    More details:
    - CircleCI changed job build time to a maximum of 1h each.
    - CircleCI now permits parallelization of 30 jobs
    - 6000 build minutes a month.
    - Still waiting for osresearch/heads CircleCI project to be unlocked (currently not recognized as open source project?!)

    Output of hashes is now optional
    29/11/2021 CircleCI public information available states parallelization of up to 30 jobs at a time. Let's play
    - We first build heads musl-cross-make and persist (passing musl-cross-make into next job)
    - We then build per coreboot version board with coreboot make statement only and persist (passing musl-cross-make + coreboot's musl-cross buildstack)
    - We then build per coreboot version board (reusing past build musl-cross-make and coreboot's version musl-cross buildstack)
    Remove 4.11 boards for the moment to test only build time and parallelization

    CircleCI: base all coreboot 4.13 boards on hotp-maximized to try to free more building time.

commit 41847f5cd22dc09e7765089c8818674a7d1fa489

Date:   Mon Jul 26 14:02:42 2021 -0400

    move all other boards (but KGPE-D16) to coreboot 4.13
    - xx30 legacy boards (x230, x230-flash, t430, t430-flash) now rely also on coreboot 4.13
      - DOWNSIDE: x230 and t430 legacy boards now rely on WHIPTAIL (NOT FBWhiptail) to have enough space to fit under 7mb)
    - xx20 boards moved to 4.13 (no need of xx20-flash boards here since single SPI boards with 7.5mb useable since blobs scripts are required)
      - DOWNSIDE: all xx20 boards now have dropbear deactivated, while still having ethernet driver in.
    - qemu-coreboot and qemu-coreboot-fbwhiptail switched to coreboot 4.13 WITHOUT TPM SUPPORT (with cryptsetup 2.x support)
      - DOWNSIDE:
        - coreboot-qemu board CBFS_SIZE=0x700000 -> 0x750000
        - coreboot-qemu-fbwhiptail CBFS_SIZE=0x750000 -> 0x780000
    - CircleCi build recipe removes 4.8.1 boards altogether
      - KGPE-D16 workstation is used as new base build to save workspace layer (we removed one workspace layer)
      - Removing one workspace layer will save approx 2 hours of build time on fresh builds
      - Removing one coreboot version will save us approx 2 hours of build time on fresh builds
      - KGPE-D16 will stay to coreboot 4.11 until forward notice.
      - All other board configs SHOULD be built on latest coreboot versions

    - all: coreboot NO_POST for all boards
    - all: coreboot NO_GFX_INIT (linux payload does the graphic init)
    - all: coreboot TPM_MEASURED_BOOT (no more patches under Heads for measured boot)
    - all: coreboot DRIVERS_PS2_KEYBOARD (fixes no keyboard on soft reboot and potentially xx30t xx20t fix for random raw keyboard (to be tested)
    - all: coreboot removal of DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_5 under some boards
    - all: coreboot removal of "loglevel=3" under some linux command line options booting Heads kernel
    - all: coreboot removal of DEBUG_SMM_RELOCATION (unneeded)
    - all: coreboot INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE and COLLECT_TIMESTAMPS for all boards
    - all: coreboot CONSOLE_SERIAL present on all boards
    - all: coreboot add VBT
    - all: board configs switch to cryptsetup2
    
    xx20 hotp-maximized boards:
    - removal of dropbear (not enough space to have htop + dropbear)

    oem-factory-reset: fix whiptail height/width order

Date:   Fri Oct 29 13:26:02 2021 -0500

    gui-init: Handle overflow of list of files w/failed hashes
    
    When files in /boot fail hash verification, the list of files
    can sometimes overflow the whiptail msgbox, preventing the
    prompt and buttons to update checksums from showing. To mitigate
    this, if # of files is > 10, use less to show the file list and
    present a separate prompt to update the checksums once the file
    list has been viewed.

    oem-factory-reset: fix output when fbwhiptail is not used
    
    - Fixed inversed HEIGHT and WIDTH usage
    - Fixed height to 30 and width to 90 as everywhere else
    
    This was causing a blank screen when whiptail without framebuffer (fbwhiptail) was used.
    Actually, it seems like the width and height under whiptail calls are only taken into consideration under NEWT, not FBWHIPTAIL.

    etc/functions: Improve handling of battery charge/health calcs
    
    Some devices, like older Librem laptops, use BAT vs BAT0 for the
    primary battery. Accomodate this by using BAT* instead of BAT0.
    
    Could break on multi-battery devices, but none supported in tree
    currently so more of a theoretical problem.

    Checking the keyring for a GPG and updating the TOTP/HTOP
    status need only happen once at initial boot; the latter

    Having them repeated each loop of the main menu is unnecessary

    Fix exit codes for blobs/xx20/download_parse_me.sh and blobs/xx30/download_clean_me.sh
    
    Incorrect parentheses brackets used in those scripts meant that the script as a whole did not return the correct exit code. The use of `( )` brackets created a sub-shell to which the exit code applied to that sub-shell. Changing to `{ }` does not create a sub-shell and as such, the script will return its true return code.

    CircleCI: Overhaul with parallelisation and parameters for a cleaner config.
    
    * Bump CircleCI config version to 2.1.
    * Use commands and parameters to get rid of repeated commands. New boards can be added with just 5 lines at the bottom of the config.
    * Made use of some parallelisation. Currently a single board from each Coreboot version is built. Afterwards all remaining boards are built in parallel.

    Add `CONFIG_CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_NONE=y` to KGPE-D16 Coreboot configs. This disables microcode being included and loaded by Coreboot because of a current issue in which newer kernels panic when doing so.
    Added note to KGPE-D16 configs about the current microcode bug, why microcode is not included and encouraging AMD Opteron 6300 series users to make sure their operating system loads microcode.

    modules/linux: Add support for building against Linux 5.10.5. All patches besides `0000-efi_bds.patch` port cleanly. As a result of `0000-efi_bds.patch` missing, it is strongly encouraged that no linuxboot boards use Linux 5.10.5 until a proper review has been done.

    CircleCI: Add coreboot+musl-cross cache
    The idea here is a cache to restore from (musl-cross from coreboot version bound crosscomipler, from which coreboot is built)
    
    1- Reuse existing cache for all modules and patches created digest's hash past build matching cache.
    (If a single module or patch changes, we have cache miss.)
    2- Reuse existing coreboot and musl-cross-make created digest's hash past build's matching cache
    (If a patch was added to current coreboot, or new coreboot version was added in coreboot module definition, we have a cache miss.)
    3- Reuse existing musl-cross-make created digest's hash past build matching cache
    (If musl-cross-make module didn't change, we don't rebuild it.)
    
    Per https://github.com/osresearch/heads/pull/947#issuecomment-753507412 proposition

    Add xx30-maximized and xx30-hotp-maximized boards (11.5mb flashable BIOS regions, reproducible me.bin and generated gbe.bin and totally externally and internally flashable roms) (#703)
    
    * xx30-*-maximized: update flashrom options removing --ifd bios option, keeping whole flash of rom internally. WARNING: ifd needs to be initially unlocked through ifdtool -u on 8mb bottom SPI backup. YOU CANNOT COME FROM 1VYRAIN. IF COMING FROM SKULLS, YOU MUST HAVE RAN OPTIONAL -u OPTION FROM SKULLS. PLEASE UPGRADE ONLY AFTER HAVING A PHYSICAL BACKUP OF BOTH SPI FLASH CHIPS. MORE INFORMATION UNDER https://github.com/osresearch/heads/pull/703. This will guarantee that future flash of produced rom will reflash the ROM totally, where heads make sure of adding users customizations (public key, /etc/config.user) when internally flashed. Unfortunately, if you flash externally, you will have to reinject your public key and readd /etc/config customizations.
    
    * Adding generated bincfg coreboot 4.8.1 patch (merged under coreboot 4.13 and backported here to 4.8.1), resulting in gbe.bin under blobs/xx30/gbe.bin and instructions to replicate in README prior of automation (under repo). Note that MAC under gbe.bin is fixed to DE:AD:C0:FF:EE unless extract.sh script is ran on external backup to keep current user's MAC (Thanks to @Thrilleratplay's contribution!)
    
    * xx30 blobs: add two blobs management scripts for xx30: extract from local backup/download+neuter ME
    extract.sh: extract from external backup: gbe.bin, neuter under me.bin and maximize BIOS+reduce ME regions under unlocked ifd.bin.
    download_clean_me.sh: download and verify Lenovo latest ME version from website, and drop me.bin in place.
    Note: me.bin is 98kb, containing only BUP and ROMP partitions which cannot be modified nor deleted else computer won't boot. As a result, BIOS region is maximized in ifd.bin to 11.5mb and coreboot config takes advantage of that freed space.
    
    * CircleCI: xx30-*-maximized additional step to call download_clean_me.sh prior of building boards so that me.bin is dopped in place. This should be done by users prior of building xx30-*-maximized boards locally, which is imitated in CircleCI builds (look at .circleci/config.yaml for innoextract host added dependency and board buildings. Results on github for each commit).

    On KGPE-D16 boards, ensure linux-kgpe-d16*.config are up-to-date by:
            cp config/linux.. ./build/linux*/.config
            cd build/linux*
            make savedefconfig
            cp defconfig ../../config/linux..
    
    Resulting in only linux-kgpe-d16_workstation.config being updated.
    
    For KGPE-D16 workstation boards:
    Remove `console=tty0` from `CONFIG_BOOT_KERNEL_ADD` as was blocking Qubes graphical installer (CLI installer was launched).
    Comment out `export CONFIG_BOOT_KERNEL_REMOVE="plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles"` to provide a more desktop like experience.
    
    Removed 0001-cpu-x86-smm-Use-PRIxPTR-to-print-uintptr_t.patch as already exists as 0000-cpu-x86-smm-Use-PRIxPTR-to-print-uintptr_t.patch
    
    Added 0020-kgpe-d16_measured-boot-support.patch for coreboot 4.11
    
    Fix TPM errors when microcode is measured by initialising TPM earlier and loading the microcode later.
    Thanks to Michał Żygowski <miczyg1> for condition suggestion: `if (CONFIG(MEASURED_BOOT) && CONFIG(LPC_TPM) && boot_cpu())`

    kgpe-d16_server: boots, shows ASpeed text on VGA, controllable through BMC via SSH.
    
    kgpe-d16_workstation on ASpeed console. WIP. (Includes CIs configs to build server and workstation)
    
    kgpe-d16_workstation in defconfig format
    
    kgpe-d16 boards: pass from GPG to GPG2 board definitions
    
    kgpe-d16_workstation : Adding Cairo and FbWhpitail in board config for gui-init to work in FB mode
    
    kgpe-d16: removing plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles to fix server terminal output

    CircleCI: remove past addition to test recommendation from CircleCI: "resource_class: large"
    
    CircleCi: Ok.... lets output dmesg content prior of other logs.... I'm out of ideas. Next step, ask CircleCI for support
    
    At this stage:
    - job's "make --load" is supposed to guarantee that the number of thread doesn't exhaust pass of a load of 2 (medium, free class, CircleCI has 32 cores so possibility of a load of 32)
    - "--max_old_space_size=4096" in CircleCI environement is supposed to limit memory consumption to 4096Mb of memory, the max of a medium class free tier CircleCI node
    
    CircleCI: remove verbose build (no more V=1), in case of failed build, find all logs modified in last minute and output each of them on console.
    
    coreboot module: implement load average respect inside of problematic CI build for coreboot 4.11+ being killed in the action (32 cores with 4Gb ram get gcc OOM)
    
    coreboot module: replace nproc by number of Gb actually available as number of CPUs, since each thread is expected to have 1Gb of ram.
    
    CircleCI & coreboot config: fix merge conflict rebasing on master
    
    coreboot 4.11 kgpe-d16 vboot patches addendum, credits goes to @Tonux599

    All other patches for coreboot 4.8.1 have either already been
    integrated, or are for platforms which do not need to be migrated
    to coreboot 4.11 (they will move to 4.12 or newer).

    Change hash files only if gpg card is present
    
    Update_checksum was already changing files in /boot, befor checking for
    gpg card. If no card is present, the user will end up in the recovery
    next time instead of getting the same dialog again. Therefore, the
    confirm_gpg_card should be checked before altering files.
    
    The dead -u flag/$update_counter is used to mark the necessisty to
    update the hash files now.

    CircleCI: removing librem_mini board under CircleCI (#825)
    
    Coreboot 4.12, on which the librem_mini depends, doesn't build under debian:10 docker image as of right now.
            It was building over debian:bullseye (where 4.8.1 boards didn't) which constructed a valid cache that
            was reused when building #806 (https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tlaurion/heads/364/workflows/df9bad8d-8ff1-40da-b8d8-1b87a05be509/jobs/392)
    Consequently, more troubleshooting would need to be done under local debian:10 docker image.

    kexec-parse-boot/bls: Strip boot dir from front of grub entries (#804)
    
    Some grub configs/bls entries contain the full paths to the
    kernel/initrd files, which the parsers currently fail to handle,
    causing a failed boot without any useful error being presented to the user.
    
    To fix this, strip the bootdir prefix from the menu entries when parsing,
    should it exist.
    
    Test: build/boot Librem 13v2 w/F32 and bls entries containing absolute paths.

    config-gui: clean up boot device selection
    
    When a new /boot device is selected, wait until after
    successfully mounting the newly-selected device before
    updating CONFIG_BOOT_DEV.
    
    Also, don't assume /boot already mounted, as this can cause
    a false failure and prevent mounting of the newly-selected device.
    
    Lastly, tidy up the error output in case mounting /boot fails.

    oem-factory-reset: Fix index used for default boot option
    
    Since we sort the boot options prior to selecting the new default entry,
    we need to use the index of the entry in the list prior to being sorted,
    vs always setting it as 1. This fixes setting/booting of the default
    OS target where the list entries are changed when calling sort.
    
    Test: perform OEM factory reset with Fedora 32 installed, verify
    default boot succeeds followng reset.

    usb-scan/mount: Improve USB handling
    
    Currently, /media is mounted once per boot, which causes issues
    if a user need to change USB sticks, or unknowning performs an
    operation that mounts /media and then needs to access a different
    USB stick later (eg, updating the firmware).
    
    To mitigate this, always unmount /media if mounted before scanning
    for USB devices, so the user can choose the correct device at the
    time of its use.
    
    Additionally, add a unique exit code for user abort so we're not
    treating it the same as a failure, and use it to prevent unnecessary
    GUI prompts when cancelling selection of a USB device.

    Encapsulate changes to working directory inside subshells
    
    For the handful of operations which need to be done with /boot
    as the pwd, encapsulate them in subshells to ensure the pwd
    doesn't unexpectedly change for other operations, as functions
    which need to mount/unmount /boot may fail if the pwd isn't root.
    
    Also, set the pwd to root at the start of detect_boot_device as an
    added safety measure.
    
    Test: run oem-factory-reset function, ensure it doesn't fail to
    detect boot device due to incorrect working directory.

    Remove gnupg pubkey export in oem-factory-reset
    
    Since #758 is merged, users have a option to export GnuPG pubkey if
    necessary. Thus, we they do not need to insert a USB drive during
    factory reset. Until now the whole process failed just because a user
    did not provide a USB drive instead.
    
    This shall be fixed by this commit

    Delete AES keys of Nitrokey Storage after reset
    
    If smartcard Nitrokey Storage was factory-reset, we delete AES keys on
    it as well.
    
    Explaination: After oem-factory-reset was started the AES on the Nitrokey Storage that is used for the encrypted volume and the password safe is is not usable anymore because the smart card was factory-reset. To make it usable, a user needs to delete it via Nitrokey App. By doing so, the HOTP secret is deleted as well, resulting in a bad warning in Heads. Therefore, we are resetting AES key right after factory-reset with hotp_verification

    kexec-save-default: guard TPM LUKS usage with config option
    
    Add CONFIG_TPM_NO_LUKS_DISK_UNLOCK to allow Librem boards to opt
    out of using TPM to store LUKS key, and use it to guard the user
    option to add the disk encryption key to the TPM.
    
    Select this option for all Librem boards; all other boards which
    select CONFIG_TPM=y will have no change in functionality.

    mount-usb: replace fixed timeout with drive detection
    
    Rather than wait a fixed 5s for the usb storage kernel modules
    to load, and the user to insert a drive, check for new USB drives
    inserted every 1s with a 5s timeout.

    modules/flashrom: update to v1.2 release
    
    - Update flashrom module to v1.2.
    - Drop Thinkpad x220 patch as it's now properly supported.
    - Drop 'laptop=force_I_want_a_brick' from board FLASHROM_OPTIONS
      since it's no longer needed.
    - Migrate kgpe-d16 patch.
    
    The kgpe-d16 patch needed a complete overhaul when rebased against
    flashrom v1.2, and needs close inspection/testing as a result.
    The following changes were made from the previous patch:
    
    - dropped addition of 4-byte addressing (4BA), since now supported
    - dropped addtiion of Macronix MX25L256 and MX66L512 chips,
      since now supported
    - added 4BA erase commands for Winbond W25Q256 chip
    - dropped code to show progress indicator, since another PR already adds that

    Eliminate use of CONFIG_USB_BOOT_DEV
    
    mount-usb switched to dynamic USB device detection a while back,
    so eliminate instances of CONFIG_BOOT_USB_DEV, and derive the
    mounted USB device from /etc/mtab in the one place where it's
    actually needed (usb-scan). Clean up areas around calls to
    mount-usb for clarity/readability.

    gui-init: fix checking librem key card-status
    
    Commit 6b5adcca moved the call to enable_usb from gui-init
    to init and guarded it with CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD, but it was
    missed that this is needed for the clean boot check logic
    when a librem key is used. Add the call back to gui-init
    and guard it properly
    
    Test: clean_boot_detect works properly on a librem 13v4

    modules/libremkey-hotp-verification: make reproducible
    
    Modeled after modules/tpmtotp, use a specific git commit hash for
    module libremkey-hotp-verification. Add hidapi as a submodule with
    dummy/placeholder in modules (like coreboot-blobs), also specified
    by git commit hash. Adjust libremkey-hotp-verification patch file
    name so patch applied properly.

    init: load usb modules for devices using USB keyboard
    
    Some (out of tree) servers require use of a USB keyboard, and need
    the USB kernel modules loaded prior to checking for keypress to enter
    a recovery console. Since loading the modules affects the value in PRC5
    and can cause issues putting a LUKS key in TPM, guard the loading of the
    USB modules with CONFIG_USB_KEYBOARD and remove the unguarded call from
    gui-init.
    
    This should resolve issues #603 and #674.

    oem-factory-reset: enforce 8-char min on custom password
    
    Since the custom password is used to set the GPG admin
    password as well as the TPM and GPG user passwords, an
    8-character minimum is required. Inform the user of this,
    and validate custom password length upon entry.

    Add ability to enter custom password for OEM reset
    
    Normally we resort to default passwords for OEM reset, however we have a
    use case where it would be convenient to set a custom password instead.
    This patch adds a simple prompt (that defaults to the defaults if you
    hit Enter) that enables someone using the OEM reset to enter a single
    password that will replace the defaults (TPM, GPG Admin, GPG User).

    flash-gui: clear boot signatures after flashing a cleaned ROM
    
    If the user chooses to flash a "cleaned" ROM (not persisting settings
    or GPG keys) then the signatures on /boot are no longer valid, so clear
    them out. This allows for the OEM factory reset prompt to be shown on
    the next boot.

    config-gui: mount new /boot after selection
    
    Users may wish to temporarily boot an OS from a drive other than
    their primary boot drive, without changing the default and saving
    to ROM. Mounting /boot after changing the device selection
    facilitates this by allowing the user to then choose an unsafe boot
    from the newly-selected boot drive.

    gui-init: retry mounting /boot after device changed
    
    If CONFIG_BOOT_DEV isn't set or otherwise fails to mount,
    we prompt the user to change the /boot device, but never
    attempt to mount it to ensure it's sane, leading to
    potential failures later in the config/boot process.
    
    Ensure that CONFIG_BOOT_DEV is updated after the /boot device
    is changed, and attempt to re-mount /boot after the change.

    unseal-hotp: fix/rename mount_boot()
    
    Because of the way unseal-hotp is called from gui-init,
    dropping to a recovery shell when failing to mount /boot
    causes it to hang, leaving the user stranded until they
    kill it with CTRL+C. Instead, simply return and continue
    to the main GUI menu where the user can address the problem.
    
    Rename the function to clarify difference from other versions
    of mount_boot() which do drop to the recovery shell.

    libremkey_hotp_initialize: handle spaces in admin pin/pass
    
    Fix HOTP verfication failure if LK admin pin/passphrase contains
    spaces by quoting the variables when passed to functions.
    
    Test: set LK admin pin to passphrase with spaces, generate
    new TOTP/HOTP, verification passes.

    libremkey-hotp-verification: pass in key file directly
    
    Reading the file into a variable and then redirecting to stdin
    via echo() can cause the binary data to be truncated, leading
    to an invalid base32 value and failure to properly generate
    and validate the HOTP code.
    
    To resolve this, pass the file directly to hotp(), and ensure
    it is removed properly regardless of success or failure to
    prevent leakage.
    
    Fixes "Invalid base32 string" error seen when attempting to
    generate a new TOTP secret.

    gui-init: move Exit to Shell menu entry under Advanced Settings
    
    Exiting the GUI to a shell is not expected to be part of our users'
    everyday workflow, and thus this menu entry doesn't have to be on
    the main page.

    gui-init: add Power Off to the Main Boot Menu
    
    Add a main boot menu entry to power off. This enables users to
    only verify the firmware integrity using OTP, and do nothing more.
    
    After having left the device out of sight, one might want to do
    a quick sanity check only.
    
    Since we already have a script to safely power down, we make use of
    it now.

    Add dynamic USB device detection
    
    Instead of relying on a hard-coded USB disk, it would be better if the
    mount script attempted to dynamically detect available USB disks. This
    modification to the USB mount script attempts to handle the common case
    of a single USB disk but can also handle the case of multiple disks
    where it will present the user with all available USB disks

    Add a "Factory reset" GPG option
    
    This mimics tlauion's OEM work in the sense that a user (or OEM) could
    choose this option and it will reset an OpenPGP smart card and
    automatically generate a random key on it. The idea is to allow an OEM
    to set up a Librem Key and Heads on a machine before shipping with a
    random key, so the user can test for tampering when they receive the
    machine, and then the user can choose to reset all of the keys with
    their chosen keys after that fact.

    Detect USB disk dynamically
    
    Currently Heads relies on a hard-coded config value to determine which
    USB disk to mount. This can be problematic when trying to distribute a
    pre-built version of Heads that can work on multiple disk
    configurations. I've modified the USB mounting script so that it
    attempts to detect all USB boot disks present on the system, pick sane
    defaults, and prompt the user when there are multiple choices.
    
    I've also removed the USB configuration option from config-gui.sh as
    this config option is no longer used.

    Add GPG smartcard keygen feature
    
    This change updates the very basic GPG smartcard feature in the GPG GUI
    so that it can properly support generating a key from within Heads. It
    offers the user the option to copy the generated GPG public key to a USB
    thumb drive so it's not lost as well as the option to reflash the
    current Heads BIOS with this new public key added to the keyring.
    
    I've moved the common functions required to flash a new ROM with GPG
    changes into a shared function at the top of the script.

    get_blobs: extract blobs from precompiled Purism coreboot images
    
    Rather than download large repositories of files from sources we
    don't control and patch files as needed, simply extract the
    files from precompiled, known good Purism coreboot images.
    
    This offers multiple advantages:
     - single source for all blobs, which we control
     - significantly smaller download requirements for end user
     - significantly less script complexity
     - much, much faster

    Merge pull request #522 from kylerankin/add_gpg_gui
    
    It makes more logical sense for GPG functions to be split out into their
    own menu instead of being part of the "Flash" menu. This creates a
    gpg-gui.sh script and moves GPG options there while adding a few
    additional features (like listing keys and initial smartcard key
    generation support).

    Add GPG GUI
    
    It makes more logical sense for GPG functions to be split out into their
    own menu instead of being part of the "Flash" menu. This creates a
    gpg-gui.sh script and moves GPG options there while adding a few
    additional features (like listing keys and initial smartcard key
    generation support).

    properly deal with trusting keys to supress UX confusion about trusted keys
    
    key-init makes sure trustdb is updated at run time and user and distro keys are ultimately trusted. Each time a file is signed, the related public key is showed without error on it's trustability.
    flash-gui deals with gpg1 to gpg2 migration. If pubring.kbx is found, pubring.gpg is deleted from running rom dump.

    x230: use fbwhiptail and gui-init instead of generic-init
    
    This changes Heads' bootscript for the x230 to gui-init and adds config
    options needed for it. The config is very similar to the librem13v2 config.
    
    My comparison of startup-time from a power-button press shows 2.5 seconds
    more with these changes applied.
    
    That said, the experience is smooth, the GUI is beautiful and easier to use
    than the shell and text menu, especially during setup. That's what we
    buy with startup time here.

    Set GPG_TTY before calling gpg in key-init
    
    gpg2 needs GPG_TTY set to function properly.  We set it in /init so it
    is inherited by all children.  The call to $(tty) must be after /dev and
    (preferably) /dev/pts are mounted.

    Switch popt mirror to Launchpad
    
    Launchpad offers HTTPS downloads, whereas other more obvious mirrors
    (like the one used originally, as well as rpm5.org) do not.
    
    Note: it is unclear to whether Launchpad's tarballs will always match
    the checksum from upstream tarballs. However, at least for 1.16, this

    The new URL automatically redirects to a nearby, current GNU mirror.
    
    Also, the fact that it's HTTPS helps with restrictive outbound
    firewall policies that disallow plaintext traffic (for example,
    using Qubes' firewall functionality).

    Handle the case where grep operates on an empty file
    
    There are cases when grepping for an option in the config file where
    grep will not find it, which is fine in this case, but without adjusting
    the exit code in that case it can make an entire script bail out.

    storage caused problems when you re-enter the menu a second time, so we
    will just load the storage module.

    Use global /tmp/config that combines multiple config files
    
    As part of the config gui we want to be able to have the system define
    new config options without them being lost if the user makes their own
    changes in CBFS. To allow that this change creates a function initiated
    in init that combines all /etc/config* files into /tmp/config. All
    existing scripts have been changed to source /tmp/config instead of
    /etc/config. The config-gui.sh script now uses /etc/config.user to hold
    user configuration options but the combine_configs function will allow
    that to expand as others want to split configuration out further.
    
    As it stands here are the current config files:
    
    /etc/config -- Compiled-in configuration options
    /etc/config.user -- User preferences that override /etc/config
    /tmp/config -- Running config referenced by the BIOS, combination
                   of existing configs

    The Librem coreboot is labeled with the current version and is visible
    from dmidecode and is supposed to reflect the current version of
    coreboot, however it was out of date and reflected 4.7 when Heads has
    moved on to 4.8.1.
    
    I've also added a simple change to further simplify onboarding by
    warning users who have Librem Key configured when they boot without it
    being inserted.

    To help with onboarding new users to Heads, this change will detect when
    Heads does not have any keys in its keyring and will guide the user
    through adding a key to the running BIOS. It's important that this
    happen *before* guiding them through setting up an initial TOTP/HOTP
    secret because adding a GPG key changes the BIOS, so the user would have
    to generate TOTP/HOTP secrets 2x unless we handle the keyring case
    first.
    
    In addition to this change I've simplified the main menu so that the
    majority of the options appear under an 'advanced' menu.

    fix install directory handling for git and builds
    
    The install directly should basically behave like the "build" directory.
    Since it's tracked by git, containing a gitignore file, we shouldn't
    have it in the toplevel gitignore (just like the build directory).
    
    But then, the toplevel Makefile's real.clean target removes the install
    directory. This is changed so that only it's content is being removed.

    Ignore PCR5 when sealing key when Librem Key is enabled
    
    When the Librem Key is enabled, the kernel loads USB modules at boot,
    this causes PCR5 to change and breaks unsealing the LUKS key (if set).
    This change retains the protection of the PCR5 check unless Librem Key
    is enabled.

    fix the fbwhiptail source URL
    
    The current source URL is not available anymore.
    
    kakaroto changed his copy of heads to point to his own github account's fbwhiptail:
    https://github.com/kakaroto/heads/commit/b13cc5e68d9d77ef9bfd6623b812f4205698dafb
    
    But it seems that source.puri.sm/coreboot is a more accessible home for the
    project.

    Use Linux kernel defconfig format (issue #416)
    
    This reduces the amount of noise in the Linux kernel config files
    by only storing the differences from the stock configuration.
    It adds a new makefile target 'linux.saveconfig' to convert the
    build tree's .config file into config/linux-linuxboot.config.

    Show red background when HOTP code is invalid
    
    Granted the user should really be using the Librem Key/phone to check
    for tampering (since an attacker could control the Heads background
    color) but this provides another visual queue for the user with
    the GUI menu to catch less sophisticated tampering.

    Shorten timeout for Librem Key
    
    Currently the Librem Key tests will time out after 40 seconds, which
    adds to the boot time significantly if the user wants to boot without
    inserting it. This patch changes that timeout to one second.

    Store HOTP counter directly in /boot instead of TPM
    
    The HOTP counter isn't a secret but is just used to prevent replay
    attacks (the time-based counter in TOTP isn't a secret either) so it
    doesn't need to be protected in the TPM and storing it as a TPM
    monotonic counter was causing conflicts with the Heads configuration
    counter as TPM 1.2 can only increment one counter per reboot.
    
    This change moves the HOTP counter into the file in /boot that was
    previously keeping track of the TPM counter id.

    Use HOTP TPM counter instead of Heads when signing, if present
    
    TPM v1.2 has a limitation in that only a single monotonic counter can be
    incremented between reboots [1]. So in the event we are using HOTP
    monotonic counters, we need to reference those for the Heads rollback
    counter when we update file signatures in /boot, otherwise the increment
    stage at kexec-sign-config will fail since at each boot, the HOTP
    monotonic counter has already been incremented.

    The section in gui-init that modifies the Heads TPM counter when signing
    config was accidentally removed. This change adds that section back.

    Add Librem Key support to Heads
    
    The Librem Key is a custom device USB-based security token Nitrokey is
    producing for Purism and among other things it has custom firmware
    created for use with Heads. In particular, when a board is configured
    with CONFIG_LIBREMKEY, this custom firmware allows Heads to use the
    sealed TOTP secret to also send an HOTP authentication to the Librem
    Key. If the HOTP code is successful, the Librem Key will blink a green
    LED, if unsuccessful it will blink red, thereby informing the user that
    Heads has been tampered with without requiring them to use a phone to
    validate the TOTP secret.
    
    Heads will still use and show the TOTP secret, in case the user wants to
    validate both codes (in case the Librem Key was lost or is no longer
    trusted). It will also show the result of the HOTP verification (but not
    the code itself), even though the user should trust only what the Librem
    Key displays, so the user can confirm that both the device and Heads are
    in sync. If HOTP is enabled, Heads will maintain a new TPM counter
    separate from the Heads TPM counter that will increment each time HOTP
    codes are checked.
    
    This change also modifies the routines that update TOTP so that if
    the Librem Key executables are present it will also update HOTP codes
    and synchronize them with a Librem Key.

    x230: remove 4M and 8M split-images from the build
    
    The bios regions of the 12M coreboot image is 7M: 4M and 3 of the 8M split
    image. The rest of the 8M image _generated_ with fake data and not usable
    on real systems! It's dangerous to create them and suggest flashing them
    externally.
    
    That's exactly why the x230-flash build target is there: To
    have a self-contained 4M image and enable easy unlocking of the 8M image
    using the _original_ data.
    
    the heads-wiki project is updated accordingly.
    
    Closes #307
    Closes #302

    Add VBT file to coreboot image.
    
    Adding the VBT file makes it available through some ACPI memory area
    and apparently the VBT contains the information needed by the i915 driver
    in order to figure out how to control the screen's backlight.
    Without the VBT, we can't control the screen backlight with Fn-F5/Fn-F6
    anymore.

    Add BIOS ROM editing features to flash GUI
    
    In addition to being able to flash a ROM from the GUI, it would also be
    useful for a user to be able to add a GPG key to their keyring using the
    flashing tool. This change adds the ability for a user to edit both a
    ROM located on a USB key and also edit the running BIOS by using
    flashrom to make a local copy of the running BIOS, edit it, then reflash
    it. This also supports the upcoming delete feature in CBFS for
    circumstances where keyring files already exist within CBFS.

    If we want to modify a running BIOS we will need the ability to pull

    read option to flash.sh and pulls down three versions of the BIOS and
    only exists successfully if all three match.

    qemu-coreboot: Add modules libata, libahci and ahci to initrd
    
    To be able to boot a disk image, passed to QEMU with `-hda
    /path/qemu.img`, the appropriate modules are needed. Strange, `libata`
    is not enough, and the drive is only detected, when the module `ahci` is
    loaded.

    Split flash GUI into separate script
    
    To keep the flash logic simpler the GUI logic has been split into a
    flash-gui.sh program so flash.sh behaves closer to the original flashrom
    scripts it was based from. I've also removed the previous flashrom
    scripts and incorporated their options into flash.sh. Finally I set
    CONFIG_BOARD via the Makefile instead of setting a duplicate option in
    each board's config.

    Add generic flash script
    
    Based on the conversation for PR #406, we decided to go with a more
    generic script for general-purpose flashing instead of having individual
    (and therefore very similar) flash scripts for each board type. This
    script currently handles flashrom on Librem and X230 board types and
    introduces a new CONFIG_BOARD option that sets specific flashrom
    arguments based on the board.
    
    It also adds support to gui-init to call this flash script.

    Make TPM counter label a variable
    
    Currently the TPM counter label is hard-coded. By changing it to a
    variable in this function we can reuse all of the TPM counter functions
    to create other monotonic counters in the TPM (if the hardware supports
    it) with custom labels.

    Extend whiptail window to 90 columns wide
    
    Wrapping text to 80 characters works but due to font size and padding
    the maximum 80 character lines start to get truncated. Extending the
    window to 90 characters will resolve this.

    Wrap whiptail text that's over 80 characters
    
    While the whiptail program wraps text appropriately based on column
    size, the fbwhiptail program doesn't, leading to text that scrolls off
    the window where it can no longer be read. This change wraps the longer
    text output so it all fits.

    Colorize warning and error messages in fbwhiptail
    
    Since fbwhiptail allows us to customize the background colors, we should
    colorize warnings and error messages to provide a user with an
    additional subtle cue that there might be a problem. I have added two
    additional configuration options:
    
    CONFIG_WARNING_BG_COLOR
    CONFIG_ERROR_BG_COLOR
    
    and in the librem13v2.config file you can see an example for how to set
    them to be yellow and red gradients, respectively. I've also updated the
    main two scripts that use whiptail to include those background colors.
    
    If you decide to use regular whiptail, just don't set these config
    options and it should behave as expected.

    Skip boot choice confirmation in "force" mode
    
    When a user gets confirmation of their boot menu choice, that's largely
    to give them the option of making their boot choice the default. In the
    case of "force mode" there's no reason for the user to be presented with
    that dialog so this change skips right ahead to the boot once they have

    Add red background to boot console for insecure "force" boot
    
    In the event a user does pick the insecure "force" boot option that
    bypasses checksum and signing checks in Heads, it would be nice to
    provide a clear visual warning during the boot process that they are in
    this state. This change will add a kernel argument that changes the boot
    console background to be red and removes any boot splash that might
    obscure it, in the event the user picks the insecure boot mode.
    
    Since a user should only boot into this mode during emergencies, having
    it be apparent that it's an unsafe mode helps ensure the user doesn't
    pick this boot option needlessly.

    Add a gui menu for changed boot entries
    
    Currently when the boot entries change, kexec-select-boot dies. Given
    the normal loop is set up to catch this event and display a regular boot
    menu at the next iteration of the loop, instead of dying it would be
    better to just warn and then return from that function back into the
    main loop. In addition to that I added a GUI menu for the same warning
    when in GUI mode.

    Add GUI package update handler w/ checksum update function
    
    Part of the Heads workflow involves handling legitimate changes to /boot
    as part of the package manager. This is a challenging workflow to handle
    as package managers on many systems work in a completely unattended way
    (and some even reboot first, apply updates, and then reboot again).
    
    We need to be able to detect changes that are potentially caused by a
    package manager so to do that I've set up a trigger within the OS
    (currently just for Debian) that runs both before and after package
    updates. It verifies the signatures in /boot and if they fail before
    package updates it creates a log file in
    /boot/kexec_package_trigger_pre.txt. If they fail after package updates
    run /boot/kexec_package_trigger_post.txt is created. These files contain
    the following fields:
    
    CHANGED_FILES: A list of files in /boot that failed the sha256sum check
    UPDATE_INITRAMFS_PACKAGE: An (optional) list of packages known to
    trigger initramfs changes
    
    Following those fields is a list of log output from the last package
    manager run which contains its own formatted fields (I'm pulling from
    /var/lib/dpkg/info).
    
    When a user selects a boot option, gui-init first verifies the
    checksums just to catch errors before calling kexec-select-boot. If
    there are any errors it looks for these package logs and if they exist,
    it displays appropriate warnings. If the files are absent it displays a
    more generic warning. The user is also given an opportunity to re-sign
    the /boot hashes.

    Add ability to specify a series of patches per module
    
    If a file $module_$version.series exists, it will be used to
    specify a list of patch files to apply to the module.
    This is becoming necessary for coreboot which has an increasing
    amount of patches required and which makes it hard to maintain
    all in one file.

    Allow insecure boot mode to bypass kexec sig checks
    
    There was a bug in the "force" boot mode where it would still fail if
    signatures didn't match. This was because the check_config function
    validates the signatures for kexec files. I've added a few conditionals
    here so that in the case of a forced boot mode, we can bypass those
    signature checks that would prevent boot and error out to a recovery
    console.

    Create nested menus and add option to rehash/sign /boot
    
    The number of options we want in the menu is starting to get large
    enough that it's worth slimming things down in the main menu and move
    options to nested menus. Along with this nested menu change is the
    option to re-sign and re-hash files in /boot directly from the menu.

    Add a menu option to reset TPM for bootstrapping. Widen menus.
    
    One of the other core functions a user needs when bootstrapping is
    taking over the TPM. I've added a new option in the menu for this and it
    revealed that some of the menus needed more space so I've widened all
    the menus and also made the main menu longer so the options don't
    scroll.

    Add a "force" option to kexec-select-boot to bypass hash checks
    
    The point of this change is to provide a failsafe (failunsafe?) mode for
    less technically-savvy users who will ultimately be using Heads by
    default on Librem laptops.
    
    There are some scenarios where an end user might forget to update hashes
    in /boot after an initrd change or might have some other hash mismatch.
    Currently that user would then be stuck in a recovery console in Heads
    not knowing what to do within that limited shell environment to fix the
    situation.
    
    This change adds a 'force' mode to kexec-select-boot that goes straight
    into a boot menu and bypasses the hash checks so the user could more
    easily get back into their system to attempt to repair it. It adds
    appropriate warnings about why this is a risky option and moves it down
    toward the bottom of the menu. The goal would be to just have this be an
    emergency option our support could guide a user to if they ended up in
    this situation.

    Walkaround envvars passed through make(1) when generating etc/config
    
    "export" statements included or declared in a Makefile proves literally
    (with no escape) passed to the shell, which may result in shell envvars
    containing literal double quote if SHELL is set as bash, and they further
    becomes statements containing `\"` when printed with command export.
    
    This behavior could be observed by the makefile inlined at the end.
    
    This commit adds a regexp to sed to remove those `\"`.
    
    export QUOTE="QUOTE"
    SHELL := /bin/bash
    .SHELLFLAGS := -o pipefail -c
    export-quote:
            export|grep QUOTE

    Generate a fake EBDA with kexec, removing the need for a custom xen (#227)
    
    This modifies the segment at 0x0 so that it contains enough of a fake
    Extended BIOS Data Area at addresses 0x40e and 0x413 that Xen can
    correctly locate its trampoline code.
    
    Since custom Xen is no longer required, we can remove the module,
    the patches and all of the references to it in the board definition
    files.

    Fix bad slang modules file
    
    The modules file had a few errors that prevented slang from being built.
    First the src/elfobjs file needed to be created before make started.
    Second it needed to be configured without external png, pcre and onig
    libraries it doesn't need for this application.

    Make TPM dependency optional and controlled by flag CONFIG_TPM
    
    if "CONFIG_TPM=y" is not present in the config file, functionalities
    needing TPM could be disabled, while leaving other functionalities intact.
    
    This will make Heads a more general-usage bootloader payload atop coreboot.

    Replace remaining text-only options in main workflow w/ gui menus
    
    In particular I added a GUI menu to instruct the user if there is no
    TOTP code registered (as is the case upon first flash) and also added
    better handling of the case the user selects 'default boot' when there
    is no default boot set yet. Apart from that where there were text-only
    menus left in gui-init I've replaced them with GUI menus.

    Add gui option to kexec-select-boot, use in gui-init menu option
    
    When selecting the boot menu option (m) in the gui-init you call out to
    kexec-select-boot. To better maintain the graphical menu experience,
    I've added a -g option to kexec-select-boot that, when set, will use a
    graphical whiptail menu for the most common menu selection modes.

    Add graphical init menu that uses whiptail
    
    This is a modified version of the generic-init script that uses whiptail
    to generate a graphical menu. I changed two of the options so that the
    user can refresh the menu to get an updated TOTP code if needed.

    It is included in the newt library, which depends on slang. To enable,
    the board configuration file should add CONFIG_SLANG=y and CONFIG_NEWT=y

    Add OHCI and UHCI drivers to initrd.
    
    USB smart card readers are most full speed devices, and there is no
    "rate-matching hubs" beneath the root hub on older (e.g. GM45) plat-
    forms, which has companion OHCI or UHCI controllers and needs cor-
    responding drivers to communicate with card readers directly plugged
    into the motherboard, otherwise a discrete USB hub should be inserted
    between the motherboard and the reader.
    
    This time I make inserting linux modules for OHCI and UHCI controllable
    with option CONFIG_LINUX_USB_COMPANION_CONTROLLER.
    
    A linux config for x200 is added as an example.
    
    Tested on my x200s and elitebook revolve 810g1.

    Make TPM dependency optional and controlled by flag CONFIG_TPM
    
    if "CONFIG_TPM=y" is not present in the config file, functionalities
    needing TPM could be disabled, while leaving other functionalities intact.
    
    This will make Heads a more general-usage bootloader payload atop coreboot.

    Enable easy building with the NERF u-root tree #317
    
    This adds a `CONFIG_UROOT=y` option to allow the busybox
    runtime to be replaced with the go u-root runtime.
    You must have go 1.9 or newer for it to work.
    
    It has been tested on the OCP winterfell and qemu nodes,
    and it can be specified on the build command line as well.
    
    Nothing from `heads/initrd` or any of the tools will be
    linked into the cpio file.  Only the kernel modules and the
    go shell will be included.

    Build multiple boards with the NERF firmware (issue #268)
    
    This modifies the `Makefile.nerf` to create files based on the
    $(BOARD) variable, which is necessary as we start to support
    multiple mainboards.
    
    The config files must define five variables, all in bytes:
    
    * `NERF_SIZE` - for the EFI firmware volume that contains Linux
    * `PEI_SIZE` - size of the PEI image in the vendor ROM
    * `PEI_OFFSET` - offset of the PEI image in the vendor ROM
    * `ME_SIZE` - size of the ME image in the vendor ROM, or 0 if
    there is no ME image to be extracted.
    * `ME_OFFSET` - offset of the ME image in the vendor ROM
    
    The `ifd.bin` must be created and can be checked in.
    The default ROM input file is `blobs/$(BOARD)/$(BOARD).rom`,
    and it *must not* be checked in.

    Attempt to use the edk2 ACPI tables (issue #266)
    
    This links in the AcpiTableDxe and AcpiPlatform executables from
    the edk2 build tree and adds a depex dependency for the Linux
    kernel on the AcpiTable being setup.  The `acpi.cpio` file is
    no longer included in the Linux kernel bzImage.
    
    The `Makefile.nerf` has been re-written to generate the firmware
    file system (FFS) files via rules.
    
    TODO: figure out how to add LZMA compressed sections so that the
    900k acpi tables can be compressed to about 100k.

    Allow initrd.cpio to be a separate EFI firmware volume (issue #257)
    
    Add a function to walk all firmware volumes looking for a well
    known GUID that is the initrd.cpio image. Currently it must be
    uncompressed.

    also increases the size of the flashrom executable significantly
    since it brings in all chipset and flash types.

    Build the Heads/NERF firmware for the Dell R630 server.
    
    This development branch builds a NERF firmware for the Dell R630
    server.  It does not use coreboot; instead it branches directly
    from the vendor's PEI core into Linux and the Heads runtime
    that is setup to be run as an EFI executable.

    wasn't being applied properly.

    Added rollback protection to generic boot
    
    Changed the checking of required hashes or required rollback state
    to be right before boot, allowing the user to sign/set defaults
    in interactive mode.
    
    Also cleaned up usages of recovery and fixed iso parameter
    regression.

    Added the ability to persist a default boot option
    
    Similar to qubes-update, it will save then verify the hashes of
    the kexec files. Once TOTP is verified, a normal boot will verify
    that the file hashes and all the kexec params match and if
    successful, boot directly to OS.
    
    Also added a config option to require hash verification for
    non-recovery boots, failing to recovery not met.

    Added a generic boot config and persistent params
    
    Refactored boot parsing code and applied that in local-init to
    scan /boot for grub options and allow the user to unsafely boot
    anything.  This goes a long way to addressing #196.
    
    Optionally the user can customize those boot parameters or enforce
    arbitrary hashes on the boot device by creating and signing config
    files in /boot/ or /media/ or /media/kexec_iso/ISO_FILENAME/.

    usb-boot automatically uses internal xen binary / command line
    when multiboot is detected.

    adds a USB boot option with basic parsing to kexec
    
    Supports booting from USB media using either the root device or
    a signed ISO as the boot device.  Boot options are parsed with
    quick/dirty shell scripts to infer kexec params.
    
    Closes #195 and begins to address #196

    Rework /init and qubes setup scripts (issue #27, #155, #32, #29, #110)
    
    This adds support for seamless booting of Qubes with a TPM disk key,
    as well as signing of qubes files in /boot with a Yubikey.
    
    The signed hashes also includes a TPM counter, which is incremented
    when new hashes are signed.  This prevents rollback attacks against
    the /boot filesystem.
    
    The TPMTOTP value is presented to the user at the time of entering
    the disk encryption keys.  Hitting enter will generate a new code.
    
    The LUKS headers are included in the TPM sealing of the disk
    encryption keys.

    Define $(CROSS_TOOLS) to ensure reproducible builds (issue #173)
    
    Each of the submodule configuration files defined a subset of the
    cross compiler tools that it used and many were picking up the
    system `ar`, `nm`, `strip, `ld`, etc.  They all now use a `Makefile`
    macro that defines the path to the proper cross compiler tools.
    
    For ones that need the tools, but not the musl-libc gcc,
    there is $(CROSS_TOOLS_NOCC) that is all of them without gcc.
    This is for musl-libc itself, as well as xen and the Linux kernel.

    TPM disk encryption keys for Qubes.
    
    Issue #123: This streamline Qubes startup experience by
    making it possible to have a single-password decryption.
    
    Issue #29: The disk keys in `/secret.key` are passed to the systemd
    in initramfs through `/etc/crypttab`, which is generated on each boot.
    This is slow; need to look at alternate ways.
    
    Issue #110: By using LVM instead of partitions it is now
    possible to find the root filesystem in a consistent way.
    
    Issue #80: LVM is now included in the ROM.

    Build lvm command line utility (issue #80)
    
    Replace libuuid with util-linux libuuid (and libblkid,
    although we are not using libblkid right now).
    
    This also requires a much larger coreboot cbfs, which was
    fixed as part of issue #154.

    Move Qubes startup script to /boot/boot.sh
    
    This also adds a set of files in the qubes/ directory that
    are meant to be copied to the /boot partition.
    
    Issue #154: for ease of upgrading Qubes, the script should
    live on /boot instead of in the ROM.  This requires a GPG
    signature on the startup script to avoid attacks by modifying
    the boot script.
    
    Issue #123: this streamlines the boot process for Qubes, although
    the disk password is still not passed in correctly to the initrd
    (issue #29).
    
    This does not address issues #110 of how to find the root device.
    The best approach is probably disk labels, which will require
    special installation instructions.

    This addresses multiple issues:
    
    * Issue #63: initrd is build fresh each time, so tracked files do not matter.
    * Issue #144: build time configuration
    * Issue #123: allows us to customize the startup experience
    * Issue #122: manual start-xen will go away
    * Issue #25: tpmtotp PCRs are updated after reading the secret
    * Issue #16: insmod now meaures modules

    Remove populate-lib, rework libraries and kernel module installation.
    
    The populate-lib program was buggy on some systems and could accidentally
    introduce unwanted libraries into the initrd.  The Makefile now uses the
    modules' $(module_libraries) variable to select which libraries should be
    installed into the initrd.
    
    Kernel modules are now stripped and installed using a similar system.

    Change ethernet drivers to be modules and measure them when they are loaded.
    
    This is a step towards unifying the server and laptop config (issue #139)
    and also makes it possible to later remove the USB modules from the
    normal boot path.

    Fix small annoyances.
    
    Issue #129: set pipefail so that intermediate failures in a pipeline
    will cause the build to fail. Otherwise they are silently swallowed
    by the tee into the build log.
    
    Issue #128: strip was updating timestamps, making some files look
    like they didn't need to be replaced.
    
    No issue: configure was reading from stdin, which would make builds
    hang forever if a new option was present.
    
    No issue: print the cbfstool output on a successful ROM build.

    Fix small annoyances.
    
    Issue #129: set pipefail so that intermediate failures in a pipeline
    will cause the build to fail. Otherwise they are silently swallowed
    by the tee into the build log.
    
    Issue #128: strip was updating timestamps, making some files look
    like they didn't need to be replaced.
    
    No issue: configure was reading from stdin, which would make builds
    hang forever if a new option was present.
    
    No issue: print the cbfstool output on a successful ROM build.

    Quiet build unless V=1 is set (issue #114).
    
    This logs all of the sub-modules into $(build)/log/$(module).log
    instead of to stdout, unless the user sets `V=1` on the make
    environment.  It produces a much quieter build, which should
    allow integration into CI systems.

    Use a pre-built /dev/console initrd image.
    
    This fixes issue #111 which led to problems if /dev/console on
    a container had a virtualized device that didn't match the

    Update expired key (issue #82)
    
    Replace the expired key with my updated key, although users
    should add their own keys to sign their own firmware images.
    
    Todo: document how to add/replace public keys.
    
    Longer term todo: remove trusted key from the initrd image
    so that there is nothing variable between different users'
    builds.

    Make musl-cross a normal Heads module.
    
    This merges pull request #99 by @blackwellops and removes
    the ./bootstrap script since the musl-cross can be built as
    part of the normal dependency tree.

    Make modules not depend on build path (issue #1).
    
    Use --prefix="" to ensure that no destination paths are in libraries.
    
    Use -fdebug-prefix-map to rewrite build path so that it does not
    appear in the executables.
    
    Use -gno-record-gcc-switches to ensure that the -fdebug-prefix-map
    does not appear in the executables.

    Working build with musl-libc cross compiler (issue #77).
    
    Pass in the --host argument to all of the various programs
    that need to treat the configure scripts as cross compilation
    targets.
    
    This removes all dependencies on the host libc (issue #7)
    and adds some tools to the initrd (cryptsetup #46).

    Make kexec work with musl-libc.
    
    Remove unused tools (crash kernel and vmcore).
    
    Replace "%Lx" scanf formatting with "%"SCNxPTR in /proc/iommem
    reading code.  This might be a musl bug since it works with glibc
    sscanf.

    Build initrd tools with musl-libc (issue #77).
    
    This adds compilations modules for musl-libc and kernel-headers.
    The entire initrd (busybox, cryptsetup, gpgv, kexec, etc) can be built
    with the much smaller libc and it appears to work with chroot.
    
    Library paths are not set correctly and files are installed into
    heads/install to make them accessible to other modules.  This prevents
    the initrd from working without manual fixup; need to fix before
    merging into master.
    
    Build times have gone up since everything is being rebuilt more
    often for some reason.

    Remove -lm and -lpthreads dependencies from devmapper.
    
    This resolves issue #73 by replacing the use of log10() with
    an integer version so that -lm is no longer required.
    
    The parts of dmsetup that we use don't need threads, so
    -lpthreads is removed from the link line.

    Download and build almost all dependencies.
    
    As part of issue #1, we should build all libraries and programs that we
    deploy into the Heads initrd.  This modifies the module configurations
    for all of them to install into heads/install so that we can build
    against them.
    
    Add dmsetup, cryptsetup and veritysetup (issue #46).
    
    Build gpgv 1.4 as a standalone tool (issue #23).
    
    Modify populate-lib to use the install directory by setting
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH (issue #35).

    Update Heads to use the 4.9 Linux LTS kernel.
    
    No patches are required to boot 4.9 as a coreboot payload,
    unlike the 4.7 kernel that required a head_64.S patch.
    
    The new kernel is about 40 KB larger than the 4.7; the
    config might be shrinkable.
    
    Close issue #61.

    Make coreboot building modular to support multiple boards.
    
    This touches most of the module configurations since the
    coreboot build process had to add a few new features.
    The Linux kernel could make use of it as well if we need
    separate x230/chell/qemu kernels, for instance.
