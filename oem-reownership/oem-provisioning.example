# To activate OEM reownership wizard, under Heads recovery console, do:

#   mount -o remount,rw /boot
#   echo "oem_name=COMPANY NAME" > /boot/oem
#   mount -o remount,ro /boot

#
# To activate OEM automatic provisioning, the content of this file needs to be found by Heads under:
#  /media/oem-provisioning
# By default, the USB drive is mounted from /dev/sdb1 but "mount-usb" will find the usb drive and mount it under /media
# 
# Replace variables content with your own!
#
#The following needs to be put in /boot/oem for OEM name to be shown at OEM Reownership wizard first screen. Else it is going to be "your OEM".
#oem_name=Insurgo Open Technologies
#
#On a recovery shell, type the UP arrow key until you reach top of the history buffer. A command is proposed for you to change "YOUR COMPANY"
# to your own. The hardware is then ready to ship and the wizard will accompany the user in reowning the hardware and OEM secrets on next reboot.
#
# You should invite the user into using "generate_diceware-eom-provisioning.sh" script in the current directory, 
#   which uses diceware to prefeed "oem-provisioning.generated" with proper secrets.
# The user would then need to put that file under "oem-provisioning" on the root of a dedicated USB drive and connect on first boot of 
#   received hardware to reduce user errors and friction of having to enter those secrets manually.

#  GPG  #
#########
# GPG card function in Heads:
#   The LibremKey/NitroKey is a traditional GPG card added with HMAC-based One-time Password (HOTP) which permits 
#     to seal integrity measurements into the GPG card memory. 
#     
#     As a functional result, at each boot, the card will flash its LED green if the measured boot integrity 
#       is atttested or red in case of a mismatch. This provable security measure is called tamper-evidence and
#       informs the user that the Firmware (BIOS chips content) has been tampered with, or modified, and doesn't
#       match expected measurements expected by the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and validated by the GPG card.
# 
#     Heads traditionally stores Trusted Module Platform (TPM) Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) code in a 
#       smartphone through the scanning of a QR code into an OTP authenticator application when the TPM is reowned or
#       when a firmware update is applied. Through the reownership process, the firmware will be modified by inserting
#       public PGP key into the firmware, which will invalidate measurements and require the TOTP/HOTP to be resealed.
#       The TPM itself will be reowned by the user, requesting him to set a passphrase. 
#
#     *** You should use both TOTP/HOTP so you can still validate attested integiryt in case your GPG card gets lost ***
#
#     HOTP/TOTP are functionally similar, while the LibremKey/Nitrokey permits to validate integrity visually in an 
#       instant without having to unlock the smartphone, open the OTP application and verify that a 6 digits code there 
#       is the same that is shown on the screen. 
#       HOTP LibremKey/Nitrokey feature is complementory to the TOTP and shares the same codebase.
#
#     Heads also depends on the GPG card to store used private key outside of prying eyes, securely stored on the
#       Smartcard. When factory resetting the card, only the public key is inserted into the rom, which is used
#       to automatically validate the integiryt of /boot files through checksuming and validating the the result
#       matches what is signed with the private key on the GPG card.
#
#     Heads will warn the user each time boot configuration changes. 
#       That will happen when the Operating System applies core system updates (Xen, Kernel, initrd (drivers) 
#       and grub configuration) while notifying the user of any addition/supression of files expected to be found 
#       in the /boot partition.
#
# GPG usage in Heads:
#   Heads will prompt the user for:
#     User PIN: 
#       Sign boot configuration changes.
#     Admin PIN:
#       Seal Firmware changes through HOTP
#     
#  IMPORTANT: 
#   The user should always reboot the system and sign configuration changes as soon as possible after system upgrades
#   to attest the responsibility and ownership of the changes.
#
#   The user should always be cautious about TOTP/HOTP errors if he didn't update the firmware himself.
#     
#   Heads primary goal is to attest of the integrity of the firmware and /boot files.
#     That integrity attestation is based on those two practices that REQUIRES TO BE FOLLOWED. 
#
# PIN Notes: GPG PINs are protected in the SmartCard. After 3 bad attempts, the SmartCard locks that account.
#  When the User PIN is locked, the Admin PIN can be used to unlock User PIN.
#  When the Admin PIN is locked, a Reset Code can be used to unlock Admin PIN.
#   This is not provisioned by default. You will have to set one manually yourself.
#   
#  You can define an additional "Reset Code" to reset the Admin PIN manually by doing:
#    gpg --card-edit
#       admin
#       passwd
#         4 - set the Reset Code
#           Type Admin PIN
#
#GPG SmartCard desired Admin PIN to provision GPG factory reset. 
# Admin PIN manages Admin functions of the card through gpg --edit-card admin functions, 
# In Heads, the Admin PIN is required to seal HOTP secret into NitroKey/LibremKey when firmware has been modified.
# 
# NOTES: If the GPG card is lost, the user won't be able to seal firmware changes through HOTP.
# Size constaints: minimum 8 characters, maximum 20 characters, WITHOUT SPACES! 
#     (Else HOTP cannot be sealed. It's a seal-libremkey limitation)
#   No need to go crazy here. Remember that 3 bad attempts locks the account. One or two Diceware words are enough.

#
#GPG SmartCard desired User PIN to provision GPG factory reset.
# User PIN manages user functions of the card. It is used to encrypt files and e-mails, sign files and e-mails 
#   and authenticate the user in daily operations when used in combination with the public key generated.
#     That public key needs to be kept, as it is impossible to export it from the smartcard.
# In Heads, the User PIN is required to sign boot configuration changes.
#   At each boot, the imported public key counterpart is used to validate the checksums of the files signed with the card.
# 
# NOTES: If the GPG card is lost, the user won't be able to sign system changes.

#  LUKS  #
##########
# LUKS containers are used in Linux to encrypt whole filesystems.
# The whole idea behind OEM reownership depends on the LUKS reencryption of the container from the user when hardware
#   is received. Otherwise, the OEM would know the cloned image LUKS Disk Recovery Key and could hand it to authorities.
#   This provisioning wizard starts by asking you to enter the actual LUKS Disk Recovery Key passphrase to reencrypt the 
#   container completely, before changing it's passphrase with user selected one.
#
#   This LUKS Disk Recovery Key, if provided by the OEM **** SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED *****
oem_luks_actual_Disk_Recovery_Key=InsurgoTech
# This is where you want to define your new Disk Recovery Key passphrase, which will be associated to the reencrypted LUKS 
#   container after the OEM wizard is over and become the Disk Recovery Key passphrase.
#
#   This provisioning wizard continues by asking you to enter the desired LUKS Disk Recovery Key passphrase and changes 
#   it.
#
#   The Disk Recovery Key will be prompted to the user in the following cases:
#     1-Every boot if no Disk Unlock Key was added to the TPM (NOT RECOMMENDED! could be captured and used on cloned disk)
#     2-If the TPM fails (Hardware failure)
#     3-If the firmware has been tampered with/upgraded/modified by the user
#
# NOTES: If the Disk Recovery Key Passphrase is lost, the user won't be able to set a new Disk Unlock Key.
#   More importantly, in the case of a Operating System core update (Xen, Kernel, initrd (drivers) or grub config,
#     the Default Boot option will be invalidated, and the only way to boot the system will be by typing this
#     Disk Recovery Key Passphrase. ********** CHOOSE IT CAREFULLY SO YOU CAN EASILY REMEMBER IT ***********
#
# Size constaints: select a Diceware passphrase of at least 3 words. 6 is better. 
#   No need to go crazy here. It's better to have a shorter but strong passphrase you remember and not type often
#     then a strong passphrase that locks you out of the system and requires you to reinstall.
#       Use KeepassXC password manager or something alike https://www.rempe.us/diceware/#eff
oem_luks_new_Disk_Recovery_Key=InsurgoTech
# Disk Unlock Key Passphrase is the passphrase the user will be required to type under Heads to start the system.
#
# The Disk Unlock Key is another security feature enforced by Heads that makes your computer more trustworthy.
#   The Disk Unlock Key is released by the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a cryptographic component on which
#   depends Heads to measure and attest firmware integrity, and released only if the measurements of the firmware 
#   are intact (sealed). In the case the firmware has been modified, that the user lost/forgot his GPG card, 
#   the Disk Unlock key passphrase will refuse to release the actual Disk Unlock Key and will not boot, unless 
#   you to type the Disk Recovery Key passphrase. 
#
#   Heads would not be able to unseal neither TOTP/HOTP in case measurements mismatche and will warn the user. 
#
#   The Disk Unlock Key passphrase will also not be able to unlock the disk if the LUKS header is not 
#   consistent with what was sealed into the TPM when selecting a default boot option.
#
#   Functionnaly, selecting a default boot option and setting a Disk Unlock Key is a good security measure against 
#     prying eyes, let them be camera recording or over the shoulder passphrase capture. 
#     Since that Key is bounded with firmware integrity measurements from the TPM, that passphrase is bound to this 
#     computer only. 
#
#     A third party which would clone the disk and attempt to access its content later would succeed only if 
#     Disk Recovery Key passphrase was typed, not the Disk Unlock Key passphrase. 
#
# Size constaints: Best is to select a Diceware passphrase of at least 4 words. 6+ is better. 
# Use KeypassXC password manager or something like https://www.rempe.us/diceware/#eff
#   No need to go crazy here. An attacker would have 3 attempts at a time when booting Heads.
#     Use KeepassXC password manager or something like https://www.rempe.us/diceware/#eff
#   You will be prompted to change this passphrase at every core Operating System upgrades since the default boot
#     option will be modified.
