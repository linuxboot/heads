Welcome to the Heads firmware wiki! We are in the process of migrating pages into this tree.  Until then:

* [Heads overview](https://trmm.net/Heads)
* [Presentation at 33c3](https://trmm.net/Heads_33c3)
* [[Installing Heads]]
* [[Emulating Heads]] (with qemu, but not very well)

Releases
===
There are currently no binary downloads; you must build from source to ensure that you can add your own GPG keys to the image to sign your installation.

The current release is [0.1.0](https://github.com/osresearch/heads/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and should be fully reproducible on any Linux-ish system ([OSX build is not supported](https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/96)).  If you don't get the same hashes, please file an issue against the [reproducible build milestone](https://github.com/osresearch/heads/milestone/1).
