This ifd.bin is a configuration blob, and comes from https://codeberg.org/libreboot/lbmk/src/branch/master/config/ifd/t1650/12_ifd
Libreboot uses xx30 ME (downloaded from Lenovo, extracted+ neutered) as well, and reuses the dell t1650 IFD for their build, which we borrowed here with:

wget https://codeberg.org/libreboot/lbmk/raw/branch/master/config/ifd/t1650/12_ifd -O ifd.bin
