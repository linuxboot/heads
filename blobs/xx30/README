The ME blobs dumped in this directory come from the following link: https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t430/downloads/DS032435

This provides latest ME version 8.1.72.3002, for which only BUP and ROMP regions will be kept as non-removable:
Here is what Lenovo provides as a Summary of Changes:
Version 8.1.72.3002 (G1RG24WW)

  (Fix) Fixed the following security vulnerabilites: CVE-2017-5711, CVE-2017-5712, CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13080.

1.0.0:Automatically extract and neuter me.bin
download_clean_me.sh : Downloads latest ME from lenovo verify checksum, extract ME, neuters ME, relocate and trim it and place it into me.bin

1.0.1: Extract blobs from rom original and updated to 2.76 BIOS version:
extract.sh: takes backup, unlocks ifd, apply me_cleaner to neuter, relocate, trim it, modify BIOS and ME region of IFD and place output files into this dir.

sha256sum: will vary depending of IFD and ME extracted where IFD regions of BIOS and ME should be consistent.




1.1: Manually generating blobs
--------------------
Manually generate me.bin:
You can arrive to the same result of the following me.bin by doing the following manually:
wget https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/g1rg24ww.exe && innoextract g1rg24ww.exe && python ~/me_cleaner/me_cleaner.py -r -t -O ~/heads/blobs/xx30/me.bin app/ME8_5M_Production.bin

sha256sums:

ifd.bin was extracted from sacrificed X230 (dead motherboard) fron an external flashrom backup (no way found to be able to extract it from Lenovo firmware upgrades as of now):
python ~/me_cleaner/me_cleaner.py -S -r -t -d -O /tmp/discarded.bin -D ~/heads/blobs/xx30/ifd.bin -M /tmp/temporary_me.bin dead_serving_a_purpose_x230_bottom_spi_backup.rom

ls -al blobs/xx30/*.bin

-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  4096 Oct 28 16:19 ifd.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 98304 Oct 28 16:15 me.bin


Manually regenerate gbe.bin:
blobs/x230/gbe.bin is generated per bincfg from the following coreboot patch: https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/44510 
And then by following those instructions:
# Use this target to generate GbE for X220/x230
gen-gbe-82579LM:
	cd build/coreboot-*/util/bincfg/
	make	
	./bincfg gbe-82579LM.spec gbe-82579LM.set gbe1.bin
	# duplicate binary as per spec
	cat gbe1.bin gbe1.bin > ../../../../blobs/xx30/gbe.bin
	rm -f gbe1.bin
	cd -
